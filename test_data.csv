Very good and polite staff, great hospitality.

😊"
"I have been to this property in Jan 2022. Very comfortable stay, excellent ambience, good food. All staff were helpfull. A special thanks to Madam Shireen Rahman for recommending Holiday Inn Express and arranging smooth check in and check out experience for us and suggesting best itinerary during our stay in Kolkata.."
"Very good stay , loved the hospitality and warmth received at front desk .

Rooms are good , entire place gives u the smell of freshness and positivity . All the staffs working here are ready to help .

Talking about the breakfast , they have limited spread but with excellent quality . 

That spread is overcome by the behaviour of very nice staff like Saurav ( Restaurant Manager). He is a wonderful guy to meet if u are staying In this hotel .

They serve very nice Uttapam prepared freshly from kitchen which is more testeir than  dosa .

I had booked Holiday Inn express for 2 days for my business trip to Kolkata. The stay was super awesome and as my business got extended I extended my Stay with the hotel. The manager shireen made it very easy for me to extend my stay. Just on a what's app text the stay was extended and at a very competitive price. The rooms were offered before standard checkin time and it was sparkling clean. Staff is very polite and breakfast is mesmerizing. I would rate 10 on 10 for my stay and experience and Holiday Inn express. I would like to thank Miss Shireen the hotel manager for making my stay wonderful and I will always book Holiday inn for my next trip to the city.
"Excellent stay.. well maintained property.. very near to airport.. average buffet.. good food.. Cozy rooms..Great ambience..
Thanks to Ms.Shireen who was very proactive in handling my Check in & Check out process..
Kudos to the whole team of Holiday Inn express.. 
Keep up the good work."
"We had visited hotel very frequently. Very nice and good place to saty, Airport is walking distance is added benefit.
Room service and houseking is taking good care of us.
The food quality is also very good and economic.
Shireen had taken good care of us and help us to check in on time"
"I liked location very near to Airport. Very Good staff, very polite and always ready to serve. 
Housekeeping department is excellent, specially Payal and Priya both are very professional.
Improvement required in Room service department."
"Stayed at Holiday INN Express, I must say they really know what true guest service is. I reached the hotel early morning at 10 AM & got the room at 12.10 PM However I don't blame them for this because the standard check-in time is at 2 but I was early. However they still gave me the room & I must say the best one, which had a good view with large windows. Talking about the rooms it's not too big in size but good for 2 people. Rooms are clean with clean toilets too.  The staff is polite & very helpful. I want to mention specially about Payal from the housekeeping team. She remembered what I had asked for while I was leaving my room for the meeting in the morning & after I came back everything was placed as I required. Cheers to Holiday INN Staff. 

The food is great & with a lot of varieties both in Breakfast & Dinner. Thank you Holiday INN Express will definitely stay next time when I am in this city again."
"Why is my earlier review not showing?
The response from management is very routine. 
Reviews appear to be managed.
Negative reviews must be shown more prominently. My refund for cancellation of airport drop also not received."
"Had a great stay ! 
The ambience, breakfast, the room, the staff and service. 

Everything was great.

The location is near the airport, which is a plus point. 
Great for staying for business trips. 

Thank you."
"I along with my stayed in this hotel today just for a day as I was transiting thru Kolkata from Mumbai due to rescheduling og my flight.
Though check in time was at 2pm , the executive at the counter Ms Madhumita was just cordial and prompt in her duties. She made us very comfortable and did all the early arrival check in swiftly. She also arranged for our breakfast though it wasn't expected to us. It was such a nice gesture from Ms Madhumita. Hospitality was truly delivered with warm welcome and a smile. That is what needed nowadays.
Rest, the  hotel is good. The last time I stayed in Holiday Inn was at Beijing in 2010.
Thanks n regards"
"Overall good and pleasant stay. The rooms were neat and tidy. Room service was done everyday and all queries were solved immediately.
Express Café is very expensive for what it offeres. Coffee is horrible and any type of coffee is made purely with milk powder. Avoid coffee at all times at this hotel."

And for as long as it continues to exude the genuine warmth, we will keep returning back here again and again..Under MS.sumana, the hotel feels much more guest friendly, and has regained the x-factor which had initially drawn us to it...

First and foremost, we were greeted into our ""second home"" with one extremely pretty, vibrant and ever smiling young lady Miss sumana . She so lovingly and with utter friendliness, do full justice to the job she have been assigned with... The entire security deserve a BIG PRAISE for their tireless efforts and again, for making us feel so at home with their warmth filled gestures...

  Our deepest gratitude to her positive vibes and friendly NEs... Also she suggest to visit mayapur also, good knowledge about belur math dakshineswar,which helps a lot. Old calcutta famous  college street coffe house which is the old one, A HUGE THANKS to her for her efficiency ,politeness...
her prompt actions and her attentive attitude towards guests. She's conscientious and skillful. 

The one and only department in which the hotel still lacks in is its F&B... Still not up to mark, at least to our taste buds... Lacks the required punch that would do justice to the hotels high ratings overall...

Last, but definitely not the least, A BIG THUMBS UP to all the other departments... And as always, BIG BIG BIG HEARTFELT AND UTMOST LOVING THANKS to Sumana for taking such excellent care of us during every single visit of ours...HIEX, Kolkata will forever and ever continue to remain our ""Second Home"" in Kolkata purely because of this preety lady and the privileges we get there under her guidance..."

"Every staff member makes you comfortable. Even if you need any assistance they never say no ..., they extend all help with right inputs. COVID SAFETY IS 100%. whenever I am in Kolkata I stay at this place...
We Had a great time with family and friends . Amazing food , great service from staff. Wonderful ambience too.. and we do recommend Lemon Tree Kolkata. It was child friendly too ,beautiful outdoors to walk around.
They have been always attending to the guest requirement in time. Restaurant , breakfast quality and spread very good. Just because of few staff like Mr.Ranajit we got some relief and special attention. Wish all the good working staff to do well and continue to support the clients....."
"The food was excellent and the Service as well. Everything we ordered was fresh and
delicions. Hospitality & Responce is too good. Special application to Sajjad , Rohith and Pradipta. Keep up the good work and all the best."
"It was a very smooth stay , with great amenities,  well trained and helpful staff, great location on main road  just beside malls .. lots of covid related precautions are taken care... classy decorations... cafeteria has good food ... fully secure and safe environment.  Good for families with children also . Food well served in rooms if requested."
"Thank you very much for all good food , specially prepared jain. Good Suppprt given during stay. During local visit extends support given for arranging lunch. Rooms are quite specious and good city view."
"First of all you can say it's a 3 star hotel. Poor service and food quality. Property is totally understaffed.

ROOM: Rooms are okay. If we compare with price not up to the mark but rooms are clean and specious. We had booked for a king bed but they provide two separate single bed. After complaint front desk replied that's what they have at this moment and can't do anything. So I will rate them 3/5.

SERVICE: 1/5. Property is totally understaffed. A lot of unprofessional trainne are working there. For a small thing you have to wait a lit whether it is check in check out room service or food. There is no exception in this.

FOOD: 1/5. Don't trust me you guys can check their resturant's rating too in this matter. Worst type of experience. Extremely costly but tasteless food. Not just taste if you are really hungry I will say it's better to go outside and grab some food. We had to wait for 1 and a half our for out food and after this long time they delivered us wrong items. 

Good part is you can enjoy a good view of the city  from the room. 
Location is pretty good. Ecopark, axis Mall, biswa Bangla gate all this things are really close to the property.

Suggestions: If you really want to spare more than 5-6k for a stay don't choose this property. If you are getting this property for 3k per night then it's okay not more than that."
"We visited Citrus Cafe for birthday celebration of our son. It was a wonderful experience and had great time. Food was awesome with great taste. And special thanks to Mr.Sajjad, Mayukh and Pradipta for great hospitality."

Best house keeping service we have used ever. Mr. Kabir has attended us very politly and his behavior was vary calm and nice. Other hotel service is also satisfactory. Specially the breakfast was very tasty and soothing.
I went to the restaurant with my family including my daughter this week. It was a nice experience. Food quality was great. Would like to mention specifically Mr Ranajit Biswas. He was really cooperative and very kind to cater our different food  for older people and for kids. Will like to visit again soon.
"We went for a family dinner in Lemon Tree kolkata and had a great time. Food was really good, very warming staff . We were greeted by Ranajit Biswas in the restaurant  Citrus  and he is really efficient and kind to cater all our different needs. I loved the buffet but my favourite was Fish Malbar curry. Will definitely visit again."
"Travelled on work. Appreciated the cleaniliness and hygiene standards, given the Covid situation. 
Not too far from the airpoert, so that was good too. uber and cabs can easily be got, and it has  couple of malls at a walking distance,
only breakfast was open during that time some months ago, and room service, so food wise it was a bit limited."
"It was a nice experience at Lemon Tree Premier Kolkata, smooth check in and well taken care of our group, special thanks to Mr.Abul ji sales person and front office manager Ms.Tripti Ji.

Perfect place for budget Friendly Event's and Group. Do Contact Us for Any Help in Booking of Event's/ Groups.

"I have stay almost 3-4 times always it is really nice..
But this time I was really upset with the staff behaviour at front desk she (Ms. Brotati) was not atall professional and polite or rather welcoming, she was very rude ,arogent from the time of check in as if we staying at the hotel for free and she is giving us some kind favours out of no where.
This is seriously not expected from a well organised hotel and this is not what a Customer pays for....?? 
Other than that it is always nice to stay here food is amazing..."
"Very Nice Service
Food was excellent
Nice location
Good Ambience
Hygiene well maintained
Rooms well maintained
All covid rules being followed
Management extremely co-operative
Banquet hall was also very nice"
"My stay was too comfortable and way better than expected. When I entered, I was greeted by someone called Ms. Bratati from reception, she was really sweet, polite and also very cooperative. She made my checkin so easy. I didn't have to wait for too long for that. 
Then coming into the room, it was quite spacious including all the things you need for a luxurious stay, maintaining all the safety and hygiene measurements. I visited when Covid19 was still on, so I was a little septic, but inside the hotels everything was properly clean and tidy, which I absolutely liked. One thing I liked the best was the night view of the city through the gigantic window, from the 9th floor.
And otherwise I loved the stay all together. Gonna come again for sure. I'll recommend this hotel to others as well. 
Good wishes to LTPK."
"We visited the restaurant today i.e. on 7.11.2021 for lunch.
Food served was Orson. 
Chef Mr. Subhankar had given personal attention to make the dishes testy. Each item was with unique fragrance and taste. We all enjoyed the Chinese dishes to the fullest. This has become our favorite enjoyable place. 
Hoping that the regular  Chinese Restaurant will open soon to enjoy more dishes of Mr. Subhankar, the professional Chef of Lemon Tree, New Town, Kolkata. 

With all Good Wishes, 

Subrata Mishra"
"We had Asian food at the hotel and Chef Subhankar ensured that it was heavenly.

Food was at its best and the Taste was out of the world.

It is the special care of Chef Subhankar and his love poured into the food which makes me flock this place again and again. 

Lets hope RON opens soon for an even amazing experience."

"On 17th october I stayed with my family and frnds at lemon tree. It was an outstanding experience I am really obliged by the Hospitality of all the staffs.

Please keep up the good work"
The staff are amazing  very humble  people helpful and understanding. They are providing  very good service  and  my Special thanks to staff Miss Arina and Mr Ranajit. Love to comeback soon and meet you guys agin.
"Pros

Good room 
Excellent location
Good city view
Good furniture
Pool facilities

Cons

Very late responding front desk. No one looked happy
Average food. Taste is good. Not too flashy
Washrooms smell a bit bad maybe because they use recycled water
House keeping staff is not proactive"
"Hello, 

I have visited lemon tree 3-4 times. My recent visit was  on 27th sept, I stayed in room no. 1001. The view from that room was amazing! I would deeply like to thank Mr. Ghosh for upgrading my room from deluxe to executive room. He has been really kind. 

Nextly, I would love to thank Allpriya (i hope her spelling is correct) . The toilet accessories like Towel, Hand towel, Handwash, Moisturizer, Shower Cap were missing. So again and again I had to tell her, and she cooperated and got me everything. She took 3 rounds to get me everything because I reminded her of something or the other whatever came in my notice. She was a sweet girl, devoted to work. She definitely deserves promotion! 

Lastly, I would like to thank Mayup from In Room Dining, who offered me amazing manchow soup (which I ordered twice xD) and took feedback every time after I finished having it. 
He also offered a complimentary cold coffee to compensate as the manchow soup quantity was less according to me. The cold coffee was amazing and of good quantity! Thank you Mayup! 

Overall, thank you lemon tree for an amazing service. 

To Improve : The taxes are somewhat on the higher end. They charged 175rs excluding taxes just for a sprite can. Also, they include service charge in everything including food and room.  
My bill for 2 Manchow soup and 1 sprite can was 580rs approx including taxes. 
Whereas in the menu it's written Manchow soup for Rs 135/139rs (around)."
"Amazing experience with great hospitality and great staff behaviour specially Sunanda, Riya was really great in hospitality we enjoyed our stay.We are looking forward for our next stay in amaya in future."
"Room was  very nicely kept. No complaints on that.But  food needs drastic improvement. May be this is due to post pandemic effects as there are very few eating out. Hope they will come up with good food soon.
Those who wish to stay in New Town it is good choice. "
It was a very pleasant hotel stay. Specifically the F&B services and cleanliness of the hotel amazing. A very very special thanks to Mr. Mayukh. He is such a humble personality. The food was served to me was extremely fresh and tasty. Thank you for the excellent service.
"I have been a sort of regular customer of Lemon Tree Premier, New Town for quite a long time now and it all started during the pandemic. I was searching for hotels during the lockdown period as I had some family medical emergency for which I had to travel to Kolkata. Lemon Tree Premier not only helped me during that time but has been really wonderful throughout my stays. They have been quite hospitable and shown great care for my ailing family member. Just to give a shout-out to Faiz who has been wonderful in helping us in all our stays and sorting out all the issues that we had faced. Thanks a ton to Lemon Tree for standing by my side when I needed the most and thanks a ton to Faiz who has been taking care of all our request with a smiling face."
"Stayed for 2 days at Lemon Tree premium newtown, Kolkata in Feb 2021 with my family. We spent a nice time. Due to covid restrictions we could not visit swimming pool, it was also winter though :)
We got discounted price from lemon tree site.
Lots of options were available at morning buffet.
Better to choose breakfast package, as ala-carte would be a pinch to pocket.
Room service and Overall stay was pretty good. My kid liked it a lot."
"Yesterday night we are going to dinner at lemontree hotel really amazing  food we are enjoying  a lot 

 Staf are free kind very good hospitality 
Too hard worker . Surely we will visit again

"It’s a wonderful  property with arial view from rooms . I would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the service and care I received from lemon tree kolkata new town during my stay on 14th august room no 201 . I had a wonderful stay . Mr. Faiz rehman at front office was so polite and full of patience and always willing to give you special attention on all your questions whatever you asked  .I want to extend my thanks to Mr Kaushal from housekeeping who was there in lessthan 2 minutes whenever you call at frontdesk for housekeeping. Also I want to thank Ms Bratati who ensure my check in and check out real quick . The food here is  awesome 5 star quality .    i ordered sandwich late night  and it was  in my room in minutes though i was planning to order from Zomato which was showing around 1hr to deliver  .It is good value for money . really very clean,tidy and quiet . Just 20 minutes ride is sealdah railway station . I would recommend all whenever you are coming to Kolkata just try this budget friendly hotel with awesome customer service ."
One of the best hotel of Kolkota.Faiz one the member of lemontree is reason behind which we always visit the property and the most humble person I have ever met .one should visit the property it is Kolkota  one of the best hotel
"The stay was awesome , room was hygienic, food prepared by Chef Rohit Hari was fantastic, we liked the service of Mr Sajjad from Citrus cafe and Mr Faiz from front office. Hope to stay there again soon."
"I would like to thank Mr TARIQUE & Mr NAKUL for providing me with such a clean and tidy room with all the amenities and eye catching towel art. What else a guest need apart from neat & clean room especially in today's scenario when everyone is going through a bad phase during this pandemic. I would also like to thank Mr PRIYOJIT and Mr SAJJAD from F&B team to help me out during my time in coffee shop. Also thanks to Mr SAYANTAN from FO team to provide me with nice room with such a lovely view to just sit & relax. Last but not the least a big thanks to Mr PRABHAT (EHK) for having such a lovely and trained professional. I am overwhelmed with there professionalism and hospitality which makes my stay and 1st anniversary a memorable one. 
CHEERS !!! & KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
We where overwhelmed with hospitality of the Citrus cafe Mr.Ranajith & Team . We felt really home . The food tasted so homely and healthy . Thanks for the team . Appreciate and hats off for your efforts .
"My experience at the hotel as an anniversary gift to my wife was a 5 star experience because of a nice well maintained room with excellent view, good interior, nice location near axis mall, good quality food in room service well priced and good portion size. Travelling after a long time after the pandemic was nothing short of mesmerizing. Even after the challenges the pandemic present to the hospitality sector I think they did an excellent job. Strongly recommended just for their nice attitude. They promptly responded to every single concern. Now for the scope of improvement they could do well to give a welcome drink even if it is a disposable tetra pack, it just sets a mood of the guests."
"I would like to thanks to all staff of Lemon Tree Premier, Kolkata. We enjoyed alot in hotel and food is also tasty. Ranajit Biswas made a best quality of food and room service is very good. Pool, gym and restaurant is also available due to covid guidelines we didn't enjoy in pool but we took pics and did excerse near pool and took a rest and felt the cold breez. Reception staff is very kind people. They help in providing cab, and other facilities what you want from there. View of lemon tree is very good for photography

Good hotel with nice housekeeping department . Overall a Good hotel experience. Food is average as well as the service but the rooms are quite comfortable and spacious for quick stays . Good experience.
Everything is up to the mark including housekeeping person kaushal ( he is very helpful ) however except food. Could have been more worthwhile if they would have maintained the standard which they did for initial days.
"This is in regards to by long term stay at Lemon tree

"Visited the hotel in April 2021 and had an amazing stay at Lemon Tree, New Town Kolkata. The services were amazing and they take all necessary precautions against Covid.

The food here is also very good"
"Had a pleasant stay at Lemon Tree Premier, Kolkata in the month of April, 2021. The hotel is located in New Town free from the mess and clutter of Central Kolkata.  The rooms are fresh and crisp as the property is relatively new. In room dining/In house restaurant menu is quite limited. Food quality is okayish. However, the F & B team are ever ready to address your concerns. Their efforts in keeping you happy is appreciable. The breakfast served in the morning is good but seems monotonous when you stay for a longer period. Rotation of breakfast menu/introduction of new items is very much needed.  The prices at which the hotel is available these days makes it incredible value for all that it offers. It is a very much recommendable property!!"
"I was stayed in lemon tree premier Kolkata it was new property I guess one year old they are maintained quit nice service was quick food was delicious and the staff here is too friendly and polite the name of staffs who helped me a lot Mr
. Shibu,Kaushal,jitu, and Pralhad who made my stay comfortable and remarkable.
 Room cleaning was tidy the took my preference fully filled thanks to team lemon tree. 
Keep your good work up thank you"
"Well accommodated hall for more than 200 guests. Classic decoration with innovative touch and in-house food catering service was awesome. My relatives, friends, family members everyone was so pleased with their assistance and service. Special thanks to Mr. Ranajit who managed everything very well."
"I had stayed at Lemontree Premiere Kolkata, as a Match official from AIFF for a period of 2 months, wherein we all were in Bio bubble and not allowed to go out anywhere. The stay was long enough for us to easily pass over, but the staff at Lemontree was amazing and they made our stay not only pleasant but also a  memorable one.Mentionable are some who stood out in their service and hospitality, Mr. Prahlad from Housekeeping had become like a fly member taking care of our day to day needs, and ensuring that our rooms were clean and tidy, alongwith Ayaanbhai and Tanmaydada. Food for such a long duration from a hotel would be a nightmare, but Mr. Pradipda and Shaayaanbhai from F&B were more like our personal cook, offering tasty and healthy food to us alongwith Mr Rahul and Mr Aamir. An organisation is not known only by its infrastructure and resources, but very importantly by its staff, and I would rate Lemontree 5/5 in this sector. A must visit for anyone visiting Kolkata..."
"This is a good hotel in low bedged in Kolkata. I was there around three months . It's a fantastic visit in my life forever. This hotel staffs are very nice. They are all times in their toes to serve you better. Thank you....

Without any complaint Pralhad & his housekeeping team did an excellent job during our stay of 3 months, they always taking care of us, they always kept my room neat & clean, kept all required toiletries in an organized way, whenever there is any problem Pralhad took the initiative to call the maintenance guy to resolve my complaint. It was the same case with the F&B team; they too were very cooperative, especially Pradipta & Sayan from the F&B team took good care of us during the entire duration of our 3 months stay."
"It was my home for 2 months and did not feel like I was living in the hotel. Thanks to the excellent service and well groomed staff who made me feel at home. The food they service is fresh and tasty. Special mention to the housekeeping department who kept my room clean and the guys at the slounge who were always ready to serve the customers even during late hours. Overall, it was a great experience and in my opinion one of the best hotel in New Town area."
"The stay was really good and the staff here made it absolutely amazing getting us everything we wanted and made us feel like home. Specially Mr Pralhad, housekeeping department kept our rooms super clean and arranged us everything that we had asked for in time not giving us any reason to complain. A must try for all the people looking for places to stay near this area. Trust me you won't regret!"
"I was visited in lemon tree premier kolkata almost for month and I got services which I want.

The staffs were very good sepcially sagar,Rahman, joydeep, partha to name a few
Thanks once again"
"Stayed there for a day and loved the hospitality. Want to thank Mr. Tayab Hussain at the reception who made sure my check in was done quick as I was in a hurry. He made sure I got a cab quickly and booked a table for me as well as my phone was switched off. Thanks for going out of the way and helping me out.

The Lalit is also associated with The Robin Hood Army which is a volunteer based, zero-funds organization which has its presence in 14 countries and works to get surplus food from restaurants and the community to serve less fortunate people. Loved how hotels are thinking of giving it back to the society, great work team Lalit."
"We have hosted our family get together in the restaurant after long time and our experience was so nice and memorable,Kudos to entair F&B team 
We will come back again ,Keep rocking and we can say one of the best restaurant in Kolkata"
"It was a wonderful experience ,everything is perfect from entering the hotel, food was delicious🧑🏻‍🍳ambience is perfect ,staff are very professional with there work and positive attitude towards each and every guest the way they attending to each and everyone..will recommend must visit place👍 kudos to entire team for making a memorable day.."
"This is my second visit to your restaurant Alfresco. Very happy to see all procedures starting from booking till every arrangements. I called up hotel and put a request to call back with details. Got call back within 1min from restaurant manager and upon conversation he shared every details I required instantly. 

We came on time and everything on place. Special thanks to the organiser team. Food is excellent and happy with smiling faces around. Positive energy all around. Service team always ensure the customer need. They took our feedback during lunch. Also keen to know if I need anything else apart from the buffet. 

Since it's a special day I have been asked to pay the booking amount in advance. But I was struggling to do bank transfer. The moment I informed them they share me a manual procedure step by step to pay through gpay - This is very impressive assistance. Although I expect a QR code payment for such big organization.

Overall exceeded our expectations like last time. Will visit soon."
"Lalit hotels in general always lives up to the expectations, be in terms of their location, food & Beverage, Rooms or there general service & Courtesies. 

This one is an excellent option to stay in Kolkata and enjoy the old world charm of the city, and cherish the comforts of good hospitality, and an experience worth every penny. 

It's a must recommended place!! 

Will certainly visit again."
"I stayed here for a Night for business trip and I found the location very central. Though people said that area around the hotel is not safe, but i found it quite safe. Staff was very helpful and even breakfast had good choice and nice food. Rooms are quite spacious and decently cleaned."
"It was an amazing stay at Lalit great eastern Kolkata. New year party was so much fun and the food was excellent. We ended our stay with a new year brunch which was an amazing experience .
Special thanks to the F&B and kitchen team for knitting beautiful experiences for the guests.
Looking forward for more such stays at Lalit."
"I had called in on the number available on Zomato and Google (033-44447777) at 10:40am on 12th February 2022, to make a lunch reservation in Alfresco. The representative (a lady) who took my call after having had introduced the hotel and hearing out my query disconnected on me in 12 seconds by stating ""Wrong Number!"".  I called in a second time upon which a gentleman took my call and was kind enough to transfer my call to the restaurant which after ringing 5-6times gave me a voice message of the phone being switched off. 

Such horrendous treatment of prospective guests is not expected from a supposed reputed establishment like Lalit. Please train your staff to treat your guests and prospective guests better.

Shall surely discourage my personal as well as professional circle from availing their services anytime in the future."
"When you come to a hotel like Lalit, you have great expectations that your trip is going to be worth it, but that wasn't the case. The staff were abrasive and the only thing that interested them is to empty your pocket. Shout out to Mr Abhrup Poddar for providing me and my buddy terrible service, and that wasn't the worse thing, I heard him yelling, berating, even to some extent harassing one of his fellow employees(who I believe is an intern) one should not treat another human being in that way. That shows how shallow-minded one can be. People like him are the reason why this world is a messed up place. And also shout to pannalal or whatever his name is. The guy solely cares for tips. He fought with one of his colleagues to take my luggage to my room. That clearly sets the standard of this pathetic hotel. This just shows that HR is doing a lousy job and should bring in people a bit more genuine. Thank you for setting the bar so low, so that the next time I go to a dhabba I'll have a better experience."
The stay was really very satisfying and pleasant hope to back soon .. The front office staff Mr Tayab Hussain and all the trainees are really very helpful  and Rima Biswas from reservation is very sweet .. Thank you will recommend others too. Place is near esplanade which is a center of the Kolkata .. They look after my every request
"Pros:
1. staff are nice and welcoming - such as mr bapan Giri in the restaurant. mr Abhirup in the front desk
2. food is good
3. good location

Cons:
1. hotel smells old and dingy
2. bugs in rooms. poor housekeeping."
"The oldest standing hotel in Asia. A bit underwhelming when we first entered the rooms. Decently sized and constructed, but maintained not greatly. But the staff compensated fully. Very warm and cooperative. Front desk was always pleasant. The spa Manager was very nice and cordial. The restaurant staff also was extremely welcoming. Giri served us very well throughout. Overall a very homely and warm experience."
"Except the ""name"" The Great Eastern nothing else here impresses anyone. Its just another Star Category Hotel. The Breakfast buffet arrangements seriousely missing professionalism. The stone hard Idlis are arranged in such a way that the buffet dispenser has a lid which should be kept apart on a plant pot while serving! This arrangement makes the stone hard idlis to get concrete! 

I stayed for 3 days and all 3 days iI pointed out the discrepencies to the concerned floor incharge at Buffet counter and the same fell on deaf ears!. 
Management should send these people to a Hotel in Bangalore to get more expertise in catering.  The floor of the Breakfast Buffet looks like uncleaned since British Regiem. The glass roof of the Buffet breakfast area too looks like the St. John's Church !!

The Rooms are just below Average than any 5 star hotels in Bangalore. I stayed in the new 3rd block 5th floor. Room no.3525.

They should rename the Property as  ""La Littered,  The not so Great Eastern"".

The entire Hotel doesnt look like the one displayed in the picture in any angle!!!

Totally not recommended property at this price range! Thanks."
"Our stay in the hotel was simply excellent. The hotel staff was ver courteous. I must mention and thank Mr. Tayab Hossain in the front desk. He was so very helpful. He always enquired about our comfort. I would like thank him specially for arranging our Covid 19 test and arranged to get the results in a short time as our flight was in odd hours. We will return again to the hotel.

"Our stay at Lalit was amazing and the staff is very helpful. Breakfast buffet was delicious and Mr. Bapangiri especially provided exceptional service and took great care of each and every need. 
Highly recommend!"
"This is the best place to stay amazing hospitality and food.
I thank the Lalit team and Bapanjiri who took care of us.
My kids wanted to come back here again.

We loved this place if you are planning to visit kolkata choose TheLalit.
Namaskaar!!"
Had a very pleasant experience. The staff right for the reception to room service was extremely welcoming and prompt. Buffet breakfast had a limited spread but the food was really delicious. The staff set the bar really  high as far as the hospitality is concerned!  Highly recommended! 
We had an amazing time at the Legacy suite. Spent 31st with friends and had a ball. The service was very good and the staff were super helpful. The food was good too and the New Years bash was fun with amazing crowd. Will definitely recommend this place.
"We stayed at LaLit Great Eastern in December 2021.
If you feel overwhelmed with the exaggeration and pushy behaviour of Oberoi hotels’ staff that turns your stay uncomfortable, and want to find some peace, the LaLit is an option you should consider.
The staff was welcoming, but not pushy, helpful and informative. Whatever problem we had, it was solved professionally. 
As we travel with kids, I appreciated that I did not have to remind the housekeeping all the time about the number of towels we would need - to give you an example.
What we found troubling was the restaurant. Not only it did not have much variety of food (plenty of options from the menu were not available), but the service was quite irritating. The food took a long time to arrive, but even longer sometimes to place the actual order: although there was plenty of waiters around it took a long time to get noticed, another long time to get the menu (the QR code), even longer for the waiter to come back and take the order. Not mentioning the time when one of the “managers” prevented the waiter to take our order. 
The restaurant experience weighed heavily on our experience with the hotel."
"Its a wonderful experience in The lalit great eastern,  food was awesome as always in lalit. Hotel ambience is excellent,  gymnasium is perfectly excellent.  Rooms are good for perfect and comfortable stay.
Wolud like to stay more in future also."
"Very polite and friendly staff.nice and clean rooms
Everything is close to hotel.service is super good .
Check in was also given early at request.do visit .
Worth for money.bara Bazar is very close .
They also gave us special kids privilege"
"I am Anand Shreekar, a US citizen living in Los Angeles, California , USA.  We flew from USA to get my daughter's wedding functions solemnized at Lalit Great Eastern Hotel, November 8-21, 2021. We had booked 40 rooms for our guests  spread over that period with about 160 room nights and also the banquet halls for the wedding functions.

The hospitality of the hotel was par excellence. The demeanor of  hotel staff ranging from the front desk,  bell boys, janitors, waiters, restaurant managers, security guards , gym instructor , banquet, sales, spa staff was unparalleled. The front desk ladies were the best and Priyanka Jaiswal stands out.  Anita  Paul from the restaurant was absolutely great.

The food at the restaurant was the best we have eaten in any hotel in India ,Europe or the USA.  My family and guests thoroughly enjoyed the stay at the hotel . The bakery items were world class.

Meraj Faiz, the Revenue Manager resolved all the billing issues amicably.

I personally thank the entire staff of the hotel for their hospitality with a personal touch.

"Visited kolkata for 2 days on a business visit and I'm very glad that I chose Lalit as the hotel. Very friendly staff, great breakfast (dosas 👌), huge gym filled with equipments and all of this in a prime location of the city."
"Felt like home 
Hygienic place
Inviting aura.
Impressive service by the staff.
Room charges mostly include breakfast...have buffet service...the food was really tasty and the washrooms are really well maintained
The infrastructure as well as the interiors are really eye catching.
Rest assured it's a great place to stay."
"I was searching for a good Christmas cake for a while now . I had the Belgian chocolate cake at Lalit over 8 years ago . I’ve not had the opportunity to try it again thanks to me being in and out of the city for ages . But finally this time I was able to get a hold of it . The taste , the flavour , the texture and the quality was the same , if not better still years after . Special thanks to Mr. Chandan , their restaurant manager who helped me with the entire process and went above and beyond his ways to help me choose , order and collect the cake . 10/10 would recommend and visit again ."
It wasa pleasant stay at the hotel. Heritage hotel with spacious rooms and good view.thr food at the breakfast was good and can increase the variety. We missed the Christmas party heard good things about it.
"Great place for a short stay. Centrally located, well connected to rest of the city. Great food and ambience. Hygienic stay during these uncertain times. The service was excellent, staff were friendly and eager to assist."
Came here with a bunch of friends for our reunion and it was such a lovely visit. Great hospitality and lovely breakfast. Would love to come back again . Thanks team ! The team was very accommodating and allowed us to party . I am sure we were a nuisance but they didn’t complain !
What a wonderful stay it was ! The people were so good they provided  us the best service It felt like a home for us it was our first stay in Lalit and it was a memorable one we had a chance to stay in such a beautiful heritage property of the 80's will definitely recommend it to my close one and will love to visit again  Thank you for the great hospitality  you provided us ❤
"Hotel is good ... Neat n clean ... But need more items in breakfast items ... In terms of cleaning n hospitality , they are upto the top class... Its great help from Zahirda n Mainak ... Keep up the good work ..."
"Avoid the Breakfast here. This is my 3rd stay here and you can clearly see that something is wrong now with the Breakfast spread. No varieties and simply pathetic. The top management please maintain your standard. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT LET THIS PROPERTY DEGRADE because of this deplorable Breakfast at your place. Please do something. Today is my 2nd day… and same pathetic breakfast, and the most ironical part is that since yesterday, we are not able to talk to the person Incharge for this Breakfast. Now, also it seems that he is available only after noon. 
Pathetic"
Had a pleasant stay at lalit. Easily accessible to metro. Staff at the concierge and house keeping are friendly.  Gave us itinerary too and it helped us a lot. Would definitely recommend it to others..
"We visited for a few days in November and had an amazing stay. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are well maintained. However, it is the service that takes the cake. The staff was very helpful at both the front desk and the restaurant. Special shoutout to Zahira who helped us plan various activities! We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Kolkata."
"i have travel around more then 50 countries of the world, and all star-non star hotels,  I have, rest house, motels, hostel and many other place, spent three night in the Lalit Great Eastern Kolkata, after seeing as No 1 rating in Trip Advisory Sight but I made mistake by choosing, as the First worst experience after having room was their Flush Valve in washroom was running continuedly with water!!!!! secondly AC was not working well, we found worst thing that as per given list of amenities in room, we had to ask for each and every small thing like sleeper, toiletries like soap was only on wash basin and not at shower area, shower gel was not place, moisturizer  was not placed, no shoe shiner was in room, only one Mineral water bottle between to of  was place and when we called for all this it took 2 hours 30 minutes to reach us after several call to the team that too after changing room due to water flowing in washroom toilet!!! Next Moring we get ready for breakfast and  called house keeping to clean room, could not complete by the time we came back after 90 minutes also,  in breakfast as written on their website it was not even half sprayed , only two variety of breads in such category hotels, two cereal only, cold milk was not cold, juice only one,  no honey, Jam where placed in buffet!! in even fresh cooked where very limited staff was in-experience as they was not known to many things and have to called for every such small thing to senior person of coffee shop or chef, over all I would say that breakfast in some remote country like Burundi Novotel or Sofitel have better then my experience in Lalit Great Eastern, after attending one function of marriage ceremony when we went to room same way we need to ask for each and every other amenities which should be refill in washroom and drinking water!!! that too have to call for two three times then it comes and feel that i am beggar,  this was continues for all three night in the restaurant even while having one Dinner too, and worst experience was wi-fi excess for which they took one night to resolve my issue, as there was NO TECHNICAL PERSON IN HOTEL DURING NIGHT HOURS TO RESOLVE IT, and there was no regret by any staff or lobby manager or front desk or general manager too!!  except ambience of hotel was only we found good due to ancient structure, and location was not also so great!!!! I would rate only one star for their services, and would never recommend to visit this hotel but all Lalit group of hotels as found and feel some of their policies and hospitalities where pathetic type with NON - EPERIENCE staff every where in hotel as well as  have NO AUTHORIES TO DECIDE ANYTHING ON THEIR OWN AND NEED TO ASK SENIORS FOR EVERY SUCH SMALL MATTERS!!"
best hotel for business stay . the location is the best part it is in the heart of the city .the stay was amazing The staff were very helpful and cooperative will definitely visit again all the civil protocol were obey
"It was amazing for us to visit this hotel. Staffs and attendant s were very co-operative. Liked the gesture. 
Rooms are perfect for two people. 
Suggestions

If possible please add evening breakfast."
"It was a lovely stay at this heritage property with a long history. The highlight was the service. The team was warm and friendly all through. The staff were pretty helpful and prompt with their response. There was hardly anything to complain - be it with house keeping, waitstaff at their restaurant or the front desk.  Also, the rooms were spacious and functional and all the facilities were up to date.

On the whole, it was a nice stay and surely wouldn't mind repeating the experience. Looking forward to being back here soon!"

Stayed here on a business visit. Spacious and very comfortable rooms. The buffet for breakfast is pretty good. Dinner buffet as well as a la carte menu is just to die for. Chef sent a dish made of Betki fish which was so completely unlike any other fish dish I’ve had before! I was mind blown! Special mention to Zahida at the Front desk and Sangram from the room service department for being such an amazing staff. Extremely accommodating staff. I’ll definitely stay in this hotel during my next visit.
Best hotel for business trip . Staffs from the front desk was very cooperative and humble They gave me a wonderful service will definitely visit again all the covid protocols were followed overall a wonderful stay
The hotel infrastructure was very good All the focus protocols were followed The food was very good The staff were helpful and cooperative the rooms were properly made . Will definitely visit again ….
Very Fantastic Stay and Comfortable for the Guest to be in like Luxury. Beautiful infrastructure and the curtious staff and very humble and sweet like Rasgulla. Vow effect all days and always with the Lalit Charasmatic stay.
"The staff was courteous, they allowed early check-in and helped with onboarding. The food was also nice and the rooms were clean and very well maintained. Would suggest anyone who comes to Kolkata, the should stay here since it is at a prime location."
The stay and the service is excellent. The decor is nice. The staff is helpful and really cooperative. The stay was memorable and excellent. The interiors and the rooms are comfy. The rooms are well maintained and excellent room keeping services.
It was very mesmerizing  while staying here and staff was very friendly. My room was very clean and room service was very fast. My family really enjoyed it and all the meals at are provided by hotel was excellent and we also tried kolkata dishes which were mind blowing.

"Had a great time! Comfortable and pleasant stay! Extremely close to all markets and places to visit!  
We managed go walk to almost all places of interest near by.

The sanitation and house keeping was absolutely great"
Had a amazing time in this heritage property. Well maintained. 😊Staffs are well trained and Negative from reception is very attentive and very helpful. Looking forward to coming back again. 🙂food was mouth watering and the breakfast is quite delicious
The hotel rooms are very neat & hygienic. The rooms are quite specious. Nice food. All frontline staffs specially from reception Neha and a Housekeeping guy are very smart & well behaved. Felt homely during my 15 days stay at Lalit.
"While the city was busy with its festivities, we sneaked past our homes to enjoy the Durga Pooja at Kolkata. Not a very ideal time to explore this city in the heat of the day but here we were, making the best out of our mundane office lives. For stay we chose The Lalit which comes with its own rich history, and it surely did well to keep up with the rich culture of hospitality. We were greeted by Miss Priyanka Jaiswal at the reception who was very helpful and turned out to be an amazing hostess, be it guiding us about the city to helping us plan the great eastern meals. She and her staff made sure we were well serviced, giving us another reason to visit the city at much better time to enjoy the city in cooler months (was not accustomed to this humidity and October heat). Do opt for the mahabhoj in case visiting during Navratri."
"Lalit Great Eastern is one of the finest in Kolkata. Located in the heart of city. Cleanliness and Hygiene is Very well maintained.Spacious Rooms with good all required facilities. Staff is helpful and quick to respond polite and always happy to help. Passing through any area of the hotel you are very well greeted.
.Namaste 🙏🏻 is what you will hear from the moment you step out the car until you leave the hotel."
I'm a frequent traveler and always I choose lalit as my first choice because the service which I recieved it's always good and the customer service is amazing and thank you @Neha and team for your valuable service and hope you guys will keep the same always
"Ordered a birthday cake from Lalit kolkata for my wife.
The cake was designed as per requirement .
Rima was excellent  in coordinating till end of delivery.
The cake tasted absolutely wornderful .
Very good work done by chef Ayan on this .
I would love to thank Rima and Ayan to make my wife birthday a memorable one ."
"So I had a great experience of leisure & pleasure at this heritage property.
Warmly welcomed by mrs.bose at the bakery with quick bites and most alluring chit chats over tea .
The food indeed was economical , palatable and had a great portion size .The old word charm can be felt while taking a tour of the property & very well explained by Mrs bose. Mr.gupta was always there to make me comfortable and feel at ease at this heritage property.
On arrival at the spa we were welcomed by the detox tea which was really refreshing .the spa therapist was really professional and had absolutely relaxing  body scrub and head massage.it was really soothing after the tiresome weekend of puja.I would recommend everyone to be a part of this heritage property whenever they come to Kolkata.
I'm planning a staycation soon ! More details sooner on my next review."
Had a great buffet on Ashtami. Amitava and Agniva guided us through some good times. The food was awesome. The spread had varieties. Ambience was just superb. The sweets at village market was an excellent idea. Thanks.
"Every food was perfect. The Risotto gambroni was the best risotto I ever had. And Biswanath left no scope to devoid us of thr best service a man visiting a restaurant could expect.

The cocktails were awesome.
And so was the food."
If you want to experience heritage with the luxury you won't find a better one in Kolkata. The staff is extremely helpful and if you are visiting during Durga Puja you would get delicious cuisine. The hotel has maintained the history dated back in 1800 and you would still see the reminiscent preversed here.
I had an amazing stay at the hotel and enjoyed the Party during this Puja. The hospitality is polite and was very LGBTQIA+ community friendly. I wish for more visit and more beautiful experiences. Taking a lot of memories with me.
Spent 4 days.. was a lovely stay . Nice gesture.. thanks a lots... The staff was very friendly. Specially thanks to Rima. She  decorate our room.. thanks.. hope to see you soon once we are back from mumbai again.
"We friends decided to party, and we stayed over Lalit to reduce the tiredness and they were an excellent host hope to stay with them
Again when we come for a party and staycation. 

The staff is very courteous and they have made sure we get things at the time of need. Thanks team."
Dropped in to savour on their special Durga Puja delicacies on Maha Sasthi. Wonderful experience of the #FourPillarsofKolkataCuisine. Right start to the festivities. Loved the food and the hospitality!
nice place...great hospitality.pleasent experience overall...good for couples in lalit and moreover the outside ambience is also soothing and comfortable...must visit for everyone to spend a nice time with friends and family...
"My family and I had a fantastic experience here. The food at the buffet was delicious and had a great variety. And the service from our server, Viswanath, was excellent considering our party ranged from my 94 year old grandpa to my 1 year old nephew. Highly recommend!"
Fantastic stay with delicious food. Breakfast spread was also nice. Rooms are sanitised and clean. Staffs are very courteous and helpful specially Neha and Ritam in front desk. Will definitely visit again.
"Staff is good, priyanka Mukherjee, priyanka jaiswal,are an asset to the organization,  very well trained and professional 
Thanks a lot for all the servics provided
Will visit again here 
Thanks and all the best"
"This is a basic 3 star hotel, at 5 star rates. 

Pros: Good service, staff 

Cons: View of slums from room (5th floor), very spartan amenities, basic toiletries, no fruit bowl/fresh flowers, no welcome drink, peeling paint at entrance. Very congested locality and facade unlike the cleaned-up photo on Tripadvisor.

We did not eat the food or the breakfast."
"I had good experience staying there , hotel has a very good location and offers good size of room. good breakfast buffet. but only down point is the staff are either less or not willing to work. so, I would say it’s a good value for money when you visit for business purpose."
Very well managed heritage hotel. Kind and courteous staff . Even trainees are well groomed and professional. HOTEL INFRATRUCTURE IS GOOD .In case of a rainy day you can enjoy your drinks beneath the glass ceiling at food court. Very well connected to Kolkata's business district and downtown.
The ambience and buffet was amazing. The service provided by Mr. Biswanath Mondal was exceptional. Worth the experience for a fantastic evening! The starter items and the non veg ones were equally delicious!
"Wonderful stay. Everything is sanitized rooms are clean. Staffs are very well trained and helpful specially Neha and Priyanka, They were very humble and polite. Food was delicious. Will plan to come back soon."
"Excellent experience - returning to the Lalit felt good.  The service is warm, the amenities and the choice of food is great.  The staff are very courteous.  Coupled with its central location, the stay was enjoyable and comfortable.  Definitely worth specially the trainees are hard working and the trainee in front office name Priyanka is very soft spoken"
"Room is neat & clean,staff are all very nice and food is like yummy😎.staffs were very helpful specially Ms.Neha and Mr.Tayab. Rooms were clean and sanitized. Priyanka and Ekta were also very helpfull. Will come back soon."
"From the moment you step in,the warmth and grandeur of this place makes sets you in awe..Well designed spacious rooms,friendly staff,impeccable  hygiene and most importantly, the food is to die for.

We checked in for a staycation on the invitation of a Dear friend,Sourav Gupta On the occasion of my Husband's Birthday.He and Mr chandan from the restaurant  made our stay a truly memorable  one. THE personalized room decorations ,the attention to detail on the cake,the baby food served to room with the right consistency of mashed potato,talk about a customized experience  and you have it here.Posting some pictures to give an idea of the experience.

The food is just mind blowing,This is hands down the best indian I have had in years..

Last but not the least,Sourav took us for a tour of the bakery and the entire property, which was the highlight  of our stay,If you want to feel the warmth and soul of old Kolkata,along with its charm,this is the place."
"Good property with delicious breakfast,

Nice decor along with super treat to tastebuds.. specially the bakery goods .. blackforest is worth mentioning.. 
Overall great experience and recommendable "
"I went to The Lalit Great Eastern - Alfresco with mum and dad for my bday lunch. 
While the hotel is absolutely lavish, the food is equally mouthwatering....especially the angara kumbh (mushroom) and carrot onion kulcha. The staff are very well behaved and provide the best of services maintaining all covid 19 safety protocols. They helped us choose their signature dishes and even guided us with the quantity that we should order. The food was absolutely delicious and my parents and I had a great time today. 
The Lalit Great Eastern made my bday truly memorable."
"We ordered for dinner home delivery on 15 tg august 2021. We had combo under special offer as well as ala kart chinese and conti dishes. Real good experience - starting from ordering to delivery at home. We enjoyed tge food also..  All excellent. All are very customer friendly. Great.

"While the hotel has all the typical luxury elements of a classic LALIT property, it suffers a bit from the fact that it is located in a very old building that's in the most chaotic part of the old town! A crumbling facade, being locked around on all sides by grimy buildings etc. However the property has done a good job of preserving and celebrating its heritage treasures. Everything from old furniture and architectural elements - from the colonial times when it was the GREAt EASTERN hotel - is beautifully showcased. So do take a tour around the property if you can. A stay at the property is like an encounter with history in Calcutta. 

LOCATION: Awesome location in the heart of old calcutta, and stone’s throw away from all historic attractions.

DINE + DRINK: The breakfast was very disappointing with an extremely poor choice of food. I didnt travel to calcutta all the way from Bangalore to be served only a limited spread of south indian food for breakfast! They should showcase bengali favorites being in Calcutta!

ROOM: We stayed in room 3608 - so this review is based on that; VIEW:Sweet view of the city and Howrah bridge ; SIZE: Very spacious room; AIR-CON: Not cool enough; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part to put me to sleep; BATHROOM: Stand in shower; TOILETRIES: Lovely Spa quality Cosmetics from KRONOKARE brand

FACILITIES: Very decent Gym with a good range of weights and Cardio machines, perfect for a full on workout! The swimming pool was closed during our stay

SERVICE: Friendly staff that took care of all our needs with a smile and made us feel pampered and well taken care of. Special Shout out to the Front office manager who enhanced our stay, and the PR & Marketing person who gave us a lovely tour of the property

HOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free medium speed Wi-Fi that works well all over the property. Big Plasma TV screen  but channel selection was HIGHLY LIMITED! So you are better off sticking to your devices and online subscriptions!"
"A fantastic stay in a cosy heritage hotel. Great hospitality, and experience. The place is renovated but the essence of the British era stays… every nook and corner has a story to tell . The decor is impeccable. We enjoyed our staycation. Every staff was welcoming and supportive"
"It was wonderful experience and Vikas was such a great support to make things easy.

Great experience to be in touch... Vikas was so approachable for any assistance and support.

Thank you so much for everything"
"Great service! Clean and hygienic rooms! All COVID protocols followed..

Good heritage hotel with great ambience. You can experience the great historic oven and ancient structures. Well maintained!

Strongly recommended!"
"As event managers collaborating with Westin was a breeze. The staff were very helpful and cooperative making our production process smoother.
Not only do they have an incredible banquet, their catering service and accommodation is also excellent. 
We would also like to especially thank Dibendu for being graciously accommodating and helpful.

"
"The Lalit Great Eastern is one of the Best Hotel to stay in Kolkata. Well designed and spacious rooms with good amenities. Food is Good and Tasty. Very prompt  helpful staff. Cleanliness hygiene is very well care for. Choice of Restaurants, cuisine, Tea Lounge and Pub all under one roof. Truly a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️star experience."
"I have always loved Lalit.. For one: The kind of hospitality and warmth I receive right from the valet till I reach the room is quite unmatchable I would say.

My overall experience - which includes our stay, the food, the people/staff.. it's just right..!! How I would want in a hotel.. Nobody's perfect.. but I can tell that Lalit is doing the best with all that's been going around."
The property is very nicely maintained and staff is very courteous and they maintain proper hygiene which is pretty much necessary in current pandemic situation I could have given more than five stars if it was feasible to rate above. In crux very comfortable stay feels like homely.
"Many thanks for your cooperation yesterday & today.The Fresh Mango Cake was like a signature item and all the items in the Non-veg buffet were delicious & non-spicy-just as we had hoped they would be.Really appreciated the culinary experience.Even the buffet is always consistent and never ‘hit or miss’.

The customer service mindset of Mr.Anand Rawat of Lalit Loyalty department always stands out and thanks to him,I am really enjoying the program both dining out at Alfresco during& ordering in."
"Clean and safe place to eat breakfast, social distancing is maintained and all people're wearing masks. Good hospitality and warm services from all staffs. We'll come again for sure. We would definitely recommend this hotel. It has ticked all the safety precautions during Covid-19. Sanitizers could be found everywhere, Staffs wore face masks and plastic gloves 100% of the time."
"We had an awesome 3 days/2 nights stay at Lalit☺️ We booked with family and friends to celebrate my birthday and we really had a great time there.

Other than the amenities and the perfect view from our beautiful room, what we truly appreciated the most was the treatment we received from all the staff. They are so welcoming and everyone was smiling and greeting you, it made our stay really wonderful.

Also, thank you to the manager on duty (Chandra) he helped us a lot when we faced a minor setback. He even called the next day to check if everything was okay already.

Kudos to everyone and see you again soon 😊"
"I had a 9 day stay in the Lalit, converted as a satellite covid facility by AMRI. Big spacious room. The service and attention was impeccable. They made food for me as per my taste and we're always available when required. Highly recommended."
"It's always a pleasure to visit east india room.. i would like to thank Pritam Das and team for their amazing service,, also i am in love with the entire view.. hope to visit again soon .. keep up the good work guys"
"One of the greatest aspect of this place warm Bengal-inspired hospitality along with the treatment of Ms. LOVELY Singh,Reshmi  Paul,Sanjay Prasad. Though I was alone still Mr. Sankhadeep Sen and Ms. Sanchayita accompanied me at The Swig with their extreamly nice behaviour.
A big thumbs up to Mr. Riki Mukherjee 🙏🏿 worth mentioning as well he was much more than a 'Superhost'. I'm overwhelmed with his amazing hospitality.
They together went above and beyond to assure I had Pleasant stay which I did. And a memorable one.The only sad part was leaving this place. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Worth coming back again ❤️"
"It was our third time eating at The East India Room, had a great time. Mr.Somath and his team knew their work really well and  fulfilled all our requirements very efficiently. Definitely visiting again 😊"
"Visited in Feb,22. Food quality and ambiance is good. Found issue with service and delivery time. Observed major deterioration in this area  after pandemic.
Cost is in the higher side, considering that people need to pay more at Raakutir, than any best class five star in Kolkata.

Considering price, service, food quality and old kolkata vibe, I would say this is not a place that good as value for money."
"While  me and my husband were looking for a 2 day trip to take a break from our exhausting schedule being both doctors i suddenly  found out About Rajkutir from tripadvisor..when we entered  the property  it gave us a feeling like we qre miles away from the rush of kolkata.though its almost placed in the heart of kolkata.the property  has been taken over by Taj.so there are some transitions  going on..But the staffs were so humble and polite they made our anniversary  special.i would like to mention few names from the front office  Lovely ,she is ""lovely"" in one word.Mr Somnath restaurant  manager who was always  there to provide us utmost comfort and fooding was of top most quality.Mr Sankhyadeep from the bar  managed an excellent  anniversary  dinner  for us.and last but not the least Mr Sujbhqjit who helped  with the full booking .
I would love to visit Raj kutir  again with my whole family."
"Excellent over all experience. Very nicely organised & executed events. Restaurant team & front desk is very attentive to guest needs & immediately respond. Few team members who excelled - Sanjay- F&B, Munshi & Swarnali from Restaurant,Natasha, Gautam Das & Lovely Singh....made all the difference to our stay. Thank you team Rajkutir."
"Exceptional hospitality at East India Room and equally good food. Had a gala time in celebrating my birthday along with friends and family. The food, especially Dungar Chicken was appreciated by the guests. Last but not least, thanking Mr. Shamim and Mr. Munshi for making the arrangements very smoothly."
"We went there for an dinner along with family friends, who were just back in India for vacation. The food and the ambience was great. More importantly the hospitality was great. Specially Samim Gazi and Sanjay Prasad was very helpful, in sharing the details about the concept. We dined at East India outlet and the ghee roast mutton is worth mentioning. Keep up the great work and Kudos to the entire team of Raj Kuthir."
"I am overwhelmed by the hospitality they offer, the property is very pleasing.  It was my sister's birthday and we wanted to enjoy some vintage bengali colonial aura kinda things. 

I really liked our host Munshi and Shamim. Both of them are too courteous. 

Do visit the place,  if you are looking for a good lunch or dinner experience. 

Their cafe, bar and restaurant, all are of premium quality

I appreciate  the efforts they have taken to remind us, our ""Rich Bengali Culture"" and the splendid efforts to preserve it."
I went there for a small family function of 20 people. We had a great time as the staffs were extremely helpful and cooperative. The food was of great quality and the overall experience was top notch.
"Food , ambience and service is superb

Loved every bit of our visit , extremely good hospitality, infact it is at it's best .

Crews are amazingly good and service is prompt . Food quality and quantity is sumptuous. Ambience is awesome."
"It was amazing experience at swig… went there for the first time and loved everything about the place…starting from ambience.. food quality.. service quality …. Courtesy… everything was outstanding…. A must visit for everyone…. 
We actually received Royal treatment… which we loved😊❤️
Special mention about Mr Sankhadeep who guided us excellently for both choice of drinks and food..

Looking forward to visit the place again"
"Beautiful ambience,  the music was really soothing. Food was too good. Even we got a mouth watering Ice-cream from chef!  Last but not the least,   the hospitality was excellence.  We enjoyed a lot, hope to visit there again."
"My friend Sanchayita suggested me  Raajkutir. I stayed 6 days there..Wanted a homely ambience,and I mush say I got what I wanted.it was our birthday. She made my day more special for me. A candle light dinner set up was there at the swig. Complementary cake was there.Suggested exactly what I would love from their menu. Took personal care of us as their family. And specially Mr Sanjay, who was so familiar to talk ,made our stay unforgettable. The special puja buffet was amazing. Mainly we were not bored like we were at other hotels, each and every staffs were approachable,and with friendly nature. Next time when we'll visit Kolkata,it will be Raajkutir only. Highly recommend"
"Had a great time celebrating my mother's birthday at Raajkutir!

The property's old-worldly charm is alluring and the rooms are beautifully maintained. We took a Premium room which was extremely spacious and the balcony overlooking the back garden was a quaint place to spend the morning in. From an accommodation standpoint, the only thing which was bothersome was that the property does not provide extra beds or even foldable cots, instead one must make do with a floor mattress - which we found to be quite uncomfortable.

We had all our meals at the East India Room whose food was par excellence. All their preparations were absolutely scrumptious! From the Chitpur Road Jali Kebab to the Chingri Maacher Malai Curry - I would definitely go back to have more. A special thank you to Shankhadeep (from the bar - the Swig) and Rehman (from the Loafers cafe) who ensured that our birthday celebrations were on point with cake, wine et al. 

Lastly, a huge shout out to Subhajit Jana who went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of and also kindly agreed to give us a tour of the floor.

All in all, if you wish to experience the Raajbari heritage of West Bengal - it does not get better than this place located in the heart of Kolkata."
"The food and ambience was good at the swing ...
 The staff ware very helpful and polite ... would love to go again ...              Mr. pritam was serving us and helped us with everything we need . A grate place to visit with family and friends.. only I dint like the locality ."
"We were staying there during the first 2 days of Durga Puja to avoid the crowds and traffic in the city. 
The checcking in process was extremely smooth and all the COVID protocols were strictly followed. Coming to the room, it was a spacious room beautifully done up in old Bengali style. The washroom has my heart, it’s a beautiful one with ample lights and an antique mirror.
However, after 2-3 hours the AC started leaking water and there was a puddle right in the middle of the room. The staff responded quite effectively and sent a technician to fix it who did quite a temporary job and assured that it would be fixed within the next hour. But, that wasn’t quite the case as water continue to leak again next day morning, when they sent an actual AC company technician to fix it, it took quite sometime but this time it was fixed for good.
All through the experience the staff were impeccably polite and offered us to change our room if required.
Overall staff behaviour is excellent, the breakfast buffet is limited but quite well made, the rooms are an experience altogether and the courtyard adjacent to the room was really well maintained and great for photography.
I would surely visit the property again."
"Don't know from where to start, it was really a great experience,  I stayed in the Rajababu Room , the rooms were awesome , the foods were delicious,  in room service and dining was also great , loved the service of Asish Chakraborty (IN ROOM DINING) , the structure and design of the property really makes you feel as if you are Raja/Rani entering your fort, a must visit place,  specially with your family. Loved the DJ during Puja 🤘 , will visit again in future"
"Absolutely delightful experience at Rajkutir.
The ambience and hospitality is outstanding. 
So is the food at East India Room as well as The Loft.
They have also helped me curating meals just the way I would prefer. 
Rajkutur offeres options for a,Day out or a,staycation.
But this place is to be experienced and sipped in like a good wine.
So do go with some time"
"Had a Business get together here with office colleagues. The dinner was arranged in swig bar due to rain and I would rate it as a 5 Star experience in all aspect. Special mention to Somnath who had took care of every minute detail and made our get together Special. 

Ambience - No words to describe . The set up was awesome. 

Food - The taste was awesome right from Starter to Main course

Staff- Each and every staff was on top to make our evening special. I would sincerely appreciate their effort. 

Would love to visit this place again. I would strongly recommend this place to all. 

Again Special Thanks to Somnath and his entire team for making the evening a momorable one. "
"RaajKuthir, is properly maintained with amazing decor and ambience giving it a Royal touch to the place also it’s a picturesque place to spend with your family, friends, business meets or even solo or couples. 
Amazing fooding experience too. 
Overall a must visit place."
"The property was beautiful with spacious premium rooms along with superb hospitality. 
The Swig and it’s cocktails stirred by Shankadeep was one of the finest in the city. Loafers cafe and the East India Restaurant all served fantastic food. Highly recommend this place."
"Who doesn't want a splash of heritage amidst the urban jungle. Swabhumi Rajkutir provides the mundane urban life with a fantastic show of our heritage with cool architecture, beautiful ambience and warm hospitality. I had visited the place last month for an event amd completely fell in love with it. The hotel consists of banquet halls where various events can be held, there are several cafes and restaurants for a delicious meal and the venue is perfect for a wedding with their picturesque surroundings. 
All in all the place is a great option to spend a lovely time with one's friends and family."
"This place used to be my play area when I was a kid after years if not a decade later  I returned to be mesmerized and shocked by the way it has been changed. Went there for living my childhood again but had no idea it changed like this so yes we ( me and my fiancé ) made a plan to stay there. Kudos to the whole team who took care of us food was mouth watering, Ambience was superb. I sure want to give  big shout to the the front desk persons each and everyone of them were just wow Aritra, Sraban , Subhajit and lovely were the ones to help us with everything. Aritra being the one taking for a tour of the hotel and telling the whole story to us and letting us know what kind of legacy we will be hugging at the time of our stay. Everything from outside is having a vintage touch but opening the door of the rooms we met the future, truly what a transition and what a explaination by him and story telling in short time while taking us to the room we got to know 90% of the story. In east India Room kudos to aman, Manoj , Munshi for there service they were the sweetest people i met even in rush handeling everything with ease but yes I found delay in serrvice at In room Dining but its ok the property is huge and can be seen they are having a huge shortage in staff. will surely comeback to enjoy the pool and spa which we could not able to do."
"'Raajkutir' the name itself is enough to describe the place. Royal banquet with amazing ambience which is simply beyond words. The place has a touch of bengal ethnic royalty and mesmerizing interior . 
The hospitality was so amazing and the food they serves are really premium quality. Perfect for photoshoot, events, corporate parties, and so on."
"This place is a royal boutique hotel of Kolkata and one of my favourite.The ambience was so attractive.The management system,staffs' behaviour were also very well maintained.We had a set buffet menu during our program and the quality of food was good.Velvet lounge was very well maintained and decorated.It was a great experience for me and definitely will try to visit this place again."
"You entered the gate-saw the royal chariot and there you are in the lap of luxury and royalty.
""Live life,king size ""_they mean it!
The bricks, the wall, the decor tells you story of Colonial time during British Raj.
The dining experience was impeccable. 
We had our very own customized Indian set menu and regarding the taste i have 2 words. Absolutely delicious!
This is my 3 rd visit.Ive been there to attend weddings before, this place was always at its best.
Kudos!"
This place heralds the 19th century Zamindari era of Bengal with its flawless scenary crafted to perfection. It is located at Swabhumi. This is the best place to relax  on weekends when one toils the whole week with work pressure.
"It was last sunday, I visited this place for the first time, it was an official Anniversary Meet.
The theme of the meet remained to be ethnic this place was our first choice.
Under the blue of the Sky, in the womb of ether, the hands that has painted it white.
Honouring the cultural impact of the 19 th century Zamindari era of Bengal. The meticulous designs and the magnificent details make this place lavishly exotic.
The marvellous decor would Definitely add to your insta frame. Each & Every Corner stated the untold stories of 19th Century Zamindari 'Babu' Culture.
Coming to their food & hospitality it was more than great. We ordered our own customized Indian cuisines, that was served with much care and love. The menu was extensive.
Pandemic Safety Protocols were extremely strict

"One of the best venue to host any occasion! Terrific atmosphere, hospitality, decor, and most importantly food is signature and top notched. The service was very good and the staff was very courteous. Will love to visit here again and again ..."
This was my first visit to Rajkutir and I was just amazed by the beauty of the place and the warm hospitality. The place is easy to locate and it took me a 20minutes drive from Ruby More. The food at velvet lounge was lipsmacking. They are following Sanitation protocols religiously. Certainly a great experience.
"Just wow! Doesn't matter you are travelling to Kolkata or you are from Kolkata. It's a must check in destination.
Paid a visit on 10th Aug as to celebrate my Son's birthday.
All I can say- the team made it memorable one'.
Special thanks to : Mr Sharwan, Mr Munsi & Mr Samim.
Thanks you guys for your warm hospitality.
See you soon!! "
It is a very nice and peaceful place. Employees out there are very much friendly. It is the best place to celebrate any occassion. Food here is also very nice. It is definitely not a 1 time visit. I loved this place.
"Well, I don't know where to begin. It's a place where I would like time to loop for an everlasting experience. It's peaceful, serene, neat, clean, and even though it's a make belief history, it still takes you to another parallel universe. This is my 1st stay at Raaj Kutir. The premium room are amazing. I stayed in ""Mejda"" (love the nomenclature of the rooms). Fantastic food, fantastic team, fantastic place.
I would recommend you to meet the amazing people at East India Room: Manoj, Munshi and Samim. The fabulous bartenders at The Swig: Sankhadeep & Subhendu. The very helpful and caring housekeeper Shubham (He is God sent) and the certainly the Front Desk Team, Subhajit, Aritra and Lovely (Front Office Manager).
Great job formed by Ambuja Neotia Hospitality!"
"This was my  2nd  visit and thoroughly enjoyed it,  D main thing  i love  about  this place  is its extremely courtiers staff, Specially  d dining  staff not only they cook  delicious  delicacy  for u but serve  u in a soulful  manner.

"My sister's wedding was conducted at Raas Manch, and the service the extraordinarily satisfying. The food was mouth-watering and lavish. The overall look and feel of the venue is completely royal. The decor of the room is also very stunning and regal. If you come to Kolkata, it is a must-go-to place. The ambiance and cleanliness of the venue are definitely admirable.

The behavior of people in management is outstanding. The kind and humble quality of staff at the venue makes it the best place in Kolkata to conduct big events.  The budget rates that it has to offer are pretty reasonable with an exceptional quality of service."
Its very beautiful place. We celebrate our cake cutting ceremony. Food and beverage was too good. Specially subhendu who was very nice person. behaviour was too good and polite. His beverage and food suggestions was awesome. And mocktail was very refreshing.  I loved that place we will definitely visit soon.Thank you subhendu to creat a memorable moment at swig.

On June 30th, we were at The East India Room for lunch on occasion of our anniversary with a couple of close family friend couples. 
My wife is a Neotia employee, we hv bn here quite a few times earlier & honestly feel that this place both on count of ambience & palette will be right up there with the best the city has to offer.
We naturally chose this to be our luncheon place for the special day, got in touch with Bar Manager Somnath to make our special day memorable for us & our guests.
Somnath & his team left no stone unturned to do so. Right from calling us & wishing us on the day, to a welcome drink, to keeping the table ready with perfect fine dining decor to facilitation of some dedicated waitors, Somnath was on the money with his stewardship. 
Since, we have tasted most of their menu we had a fair idea of what was to come in our preset ala carte. The jali kebab, the crab starter, the lobster thermidor was all on expected lines of exquisite experience to savour. 
The real differentiator, however lay with what we ended our main course. Illish, was still not in the seasonal menu, but Somnath knowing my wife swears by them arranged for a 1.6 kg delectable virgin illish only for us. Chef Swarup prepared the customized near perfect tael jhol for us. 
These guys at Rajkutir, know how to really make you & yours feel spl. There was delicious fusion desserts & some photo ops for keeps to wrap it up. The taste lingered on thru the day but the memories wld for months.
The place is premium but then the choosy do now hv with Rajkutir the best to choose from the many better ones of our fabled food  city.
"
"Best place to stay at, wonderful property with lovely people to take care of stayed for few nights and we felt like being at home. Aritra and Subhajit were very polite and nice even after check out we we hanging around in the lobby then also they were coming around turn wise to ask if like to drink or have something. We are definitely coming back again and staying here. Even their manager were so nice never felt that they are serving our stay just felt our friends. Must stay place in Kolkata."
"First and foremost, Raajkutir is my most favourite dining destination in Kolkata. It has that immense serenity which really calms my week's stress! Coming to my experience at The Swig in Raajkutir, it was my first attempt at this bar outlet.
Ambience: Mix of grandeur and class
Staff: The bartender, Mr. Sankhadeep is an expert at his bartending skills and also had can hold a non invasive conversation with the guests. He adds a personal touch by interacting with the guests ensuring that the feedback is well received and implemented.
Food & Beverage: Just one word, ""Impeccable""
Overall: A perfect 5 star experience, which I don't get even at the so called 5 star hotels in Kolkata.

With limited staffing due to the pandemic norms on a weekend, I did not find a single flaw with the service!

Kudos!"
It has been a great gateway. With great food and brilliant hospitality. Special thanks to Aritra to make it possible and getting us the desired room with a great view. This place is very much unknown to people. Its been unknown to us that Kolkata had such a mesmerizing property.
It is our third visit and yes we are always mesmerized with its beauty. Went to celebrate dads birthday. Mouth watering delicacies was served special thanks to Mr. Samim and team make it possible and Mr. Aritra who has taken care of our every visit. One will never feel crunched up in a match box it is so wide open to roam and click pictures. Must visit inside the city but feels like out of the city.
"I had ordered a birthday cake for my sister.
The cake was amazing and freshly baked. It was a kiwi and mango flavoured cake with a tinge of pistachio and fresh cream. The flavor was extremely good and got an additional discount as well. Staff was amicable and had an amazing experience."
"Had a wonderful time. The staff were lovely room comfy highly recommend.Ambience of this place is no doubt marvelous.The food was always fantastic and no matter what I ordered always delighted with my meal!

Special thanks to subhajit Jana.We went to the hotel 2nd time for this person.Hotel with a unique view.it's was soo good experience with RAAJKUTIR."
"First of all thanks Raajkutir for this awesome experience ❤️stayed there for my business trip, but fallen in love with the property specially with the huge courtyard, never felt that what to do or what can be done the ambience and the atmosphere just melted like wwwooowww, the experience got more when I asked for a cab as I need to attend the flight to Bhubaneswar, special mention to Sraban for booking the cab at early morning, as I was not able to get any, and would like to mention about the Room service as well Aman helped me over the night as he was the guy who delivered the food whenever I required, thanks to Raajkutir once again,l will visit every time when I need to come in Kolkata.

"
"In this covid and tantrum of lockdown it is time to go out and chil. This place a very calm quite and away from traffic and mob sound. Having place to sit no need to stay locked up in the room, can room around inside this huge property. People are very kind and helpful Aritra and Lovely from reception helped us with everything. Food is just awesome. Rooms are clean and well mentioned. Must place for a gateway."
"Awesome property to spent your quality time, the ambience I liked the more even my friends are also stunned after seeing the property, the rooms are very nice and we'll maintained, thanks to Sraban for the lovely showround, special mention of #Swig bar just nailed it, people's are very friendly and always ready to help you even the security guards are also very well trained the guy from patio helped me a lot.

Fabulous experience with Food and service. It is an amazing experience with joy# love # yummy food # great service #great experience ## nostalgic ambience #ighly recommend. Thank you team EASTINDIA ROOM and RAAJKUTIR.
"What a fabulous time at East India Room.
It's USP on its  authenticity in food  but this quite impossible  without replacing the man Samim. who is  Viceroy of  EIR. Our interaction was just for a meal time but being a  manager he is a  gentle man with great sense humour . He carried Guest anticipation characteristics beyond the limits and he ensured amongst team with same spirit for guest service.  Me and my beloved wife loved the mouth watering dishes and  overwhelmed with elegant service. 
Looking forward to see you on our next transit to Kolkata. Stay safe.
"
I bought a Grand truffle Cake at Raajkutir. i have to mention it was out of the world. I have not tasted such a wonderful cake for a long time. melts in the mouth. You can feel that the best ingredients have gone in to make the cake so sublime. lots of thanks to chef Sumanta for suggesting this cake. I am sure he and his team will make things better only !
"Amidst the gloomy times and intermittent lockdowns, as rules were relaxed for dining at restaurants between 5-8 pm, we made our foray to the East India Room at Raajkutir. Delectable cuisines and effervescent service cheered us. All possible covid protocols were put in place. And we spent a lovely evening after a long time."
"While in lockdown it becomes difficult to make Birthdays special.

I was craving East India Room’s Mutton Biryani, Double Ghee Roast Mutton and Mutton Shai Korma. I got in-touch  with Gazi Samim from Raajkuthir and he left no stone unturned to help me out with placing the order, and ensuring it was as good as when I last ate there.  The team also took a special effort to put the cutest tags on the food bags wishing me for my birthday, which made me feel so so special! 

Post lunch and till date, my family and I can’t stop raving about the delicious food. My Birthday lunch was AMAZING and I’m already counting days till I can indulge again. 

Thank you East India Room and a BIG Thank you to Gazi Samim for making this happen! 🙂

P.S.: I don’t have pictures, because the food was that kind of tasty, where everyone was so tempted to eat once the containers are opened, and realised we’ve  not taken any pictures once the meal was over. 😄"
"We, a family of four, stayed here to celebrate my sister's birthday. From check in till check out we were treated very well, the people working here are professional, accommodative and gives you a vibe of sincerity. We spent our time by eating at East India Restaurant. Their food is traditional and authentic in taste. Spend some good time in Loafers cafe, their bakery is quite delicious and leisured around the property and the swimming pool. 
We were offered  breakfast, no question on their quality of food however, the variety is minimum. Overall I have loved my stay, we were offered late check out which was a nice gesture from the property manager. I especially thank Aritra Malakar, Sraban Chakraborty, Syed Rizwan and Shubham who has really ensured our pleasant stay and always served us with a smile."
"A very nice hotel in Kolkata with old Bengali style spacious rooms, the swimming pool view is very nice. Hotel staffs are very well behaved and helpful.
Mr. Aritra Malakar, Mr. Syed Rizwan & Mr. Shrabon Chakraborty made our stay painless. Definitely recommend for couples or friends who want to stay private but looking to have good time during these trying times. "
"Fantastic ambience and amazing food. Price is lil high but I appreciate it as that will help in keeping the crowd nische and helps in maintain the royalness of the property. Special thanks to Shankhadip, he is all there to help you choose your drink and also give u a complete knowledge of it"
"A surreal experience was to stay at Raajkutir boutique hotel. It felt like a hidden oasis in the original texture of ""Hustle and bustle"" of kolkata. A true union of antiquity & modernity. If one is artistically inclined, the place will usher him/her into a timeless journey of overflowing art & creativity. Its a mirror reflection of the historic Bengal and its sear richness of culture, art & intellectualism. The entire staff of the facility is thoroughly professional and charming. I would like to thank everyone from the resturant to the bar and the office staff for looking after me.

And would like to acknowledge my appreciation to the group of owners to create such a dreamy place.

Best wishes to everyone looking after the facility.

Regards
Prateek"
"Been here twice and man this is a place to stay. First time we stayed and the ambience we got was tremendous after which we changed to Ibiza but we were struck by these guys, we cancelled Ibiza and went back to them these time tool 6 rooms and yes it's a trip to remember. We all loved there hospitality and food. Food was awesomely tasty and mind blowing Prakash from housekeeping was awesome he served us with every request. Aritra he was the person who handled our reservation and he is a gem of a person and cherry on the top he mentioned that we all are like his family members which touched our hearts. This is a place to stay. NOT A PLACE A PALACE A HEAVEN"
"We stayed for 2 nights, and man its the best place to stay at. Like i didn't knew that there is a palace at kolkata to stay at at sucha a reasonable price. Food was awesome lipsmacking. Spacious rooms courteous staff. Special mention to Prakash from HK wwith all the request that we made he was promt at providing to us and everytime not only he the lady of housekeeping used to say if u require just give a call we will be here. Now the best one Aritra man a lovely person he is. My uncle got the reservation from him we took 6 rooms he made sure that we all stay close by and side by side rooms and such a welcoming person he is me and my sister liked his greetings and talking to us alot. All of my fanily members was so impressed by his gestures he even came all the way to the gate to drop us. And we felt so much like home they all are awesome."
"Yesterday I went to this beautiful place to celebrate my birthday with my family.The ambience was so peaceful & welcoming .The food was amazing & the staffs were very courteous & knowledgeable .I would like to thank Mr.Shankhadeep ,Mr.Abhishek & Mr.Somnath for their amazing hospitality.
Would love to visit again."
"Before actually stepping here, I had made n number of plans with one of my sisters and every time for something or the other it got deferred. Until I actually got to be a part of this beautiful place and more beautiful set of people, who had kept no stone unturned to make our stay and visit here, top notch; I realised that the first visit here was definitely meant to be special, SUPER SPECIAL.

@raajkutir -as the name suggests it ushered us to a traditional set up of Bengal, starting from the statue of the family Goddess(straight out of Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay’s novel)the bird cage, the hexagonal lanterns,old radio to a beautiful palanquin.
On being informed by one of the group members of Raajkutir, came to know that this 13 acre property used to be a wasteland and has been shaped into this beautiful place with quaint artefacts and aesthetics to act as a telescope which helps us to see the Bengal of the erstwhile years and more specifically the style and taste of The Zamindars during that era.

I had been in touch with few of the members of Raajkutir and finally Samim helped me curate a beautiful Bengali lunch at East India Room. The beautiful layout of that lunch is perhaps the best visual representation of Bengali food, that I have ever seen. The sheer happiness when we were greeted by a kulo which was nicely decorated with Diya, flowers and a bunch of people happily smiling as they knew we were yet to unfold more of their special arrangements.
Was in love with the sumptuous food and the commendable hospitality that was extended for us. Thankful to Samim and chef Shoumik.

Today when I went back to this place. I could actually glimpse the first time here. Though this time was meant for the Loafers Cafe.

Until my next visit here, taking back the visual love of the pink and white bougainvilleas and the white and mustard wall colour."
"I can't express my experience in words bcoz I m overwhelmed. I loved each and every arrangement and coordination from the time of my booking till my exit.
Thank you Raajkutir for making my engagement ceremony memorable"
"Hi

We attended the Valentine Day bash at Swig,Kolkata on 14th Feb '21.
alongwith 3 other couples- making us total of 8 people.

Though the ambience was nice and a live band was performing but we found the arrangements were not so good and they are not equipped to handle such a big gathering.
There were long queues at the  good counters - as it was buffet based..the starters were very limited and as they were all live counters we had to either stand in line or go without food.
There was no option despite paying the very high charges of 1299 pp without drinks..to get them on table.

There was a candle light put on our big table which was joined..when we requested them to bring one more candlelight, as it was not sufficient, they couldnt despite being told again- that was not  pleasing experience at all.
Even that candle went off after ceratin time and they couldnt lit it again...they should have adequate provisions if they are organizing such events/

Food options were very limited and not very tasty as compared to the high price we paid for it.

The management should provide better food and better service if they are charging and ensure proper arrangements.
There was no manager around also to whom we could reach across there.

Regards"
"Excellent Guest Service, High Quality Food, and a great environment that was appreciated by all our 70+ in house guests and remaining attending guests. 
Glad we hosted our wedding celebrations at Rajkutir, Swabhumi. 
The managers (Arnab), front desk (Aritra, Shantanu), and banquet (Ranajit) were very proactive and took the lead wrt coordination amongst guests to ensure seamless service, room allocation, check in and check out. 
Food was brilliant and highly appreciated by all the guests. Quite a few of the guests suggested that some of these dishes were the best they ever had in India. "
"Great ambience, classy decor, filmy candlelit table, picturesque circumstances, Superbly delicious food, tireless service of AMAN & MANOBI have made our anniversary night memorable. Strongly recommended"
"Greet room with great service, it's was soo good experience with RAAJKUTIR, room with very precise decoration, but not only that the room service was great and quick, my hole room was cleaned and they also , sanitize it before my coming indeed very few hotel took care of cleanliness and sterility and this hotel is one of them, great experience you all should give it a try guys."
"After a long time I have visited part of one of the social events. Love to be back at Raajkutir. The hotel is very well maintained as it was last time. The room on first floor was balcony with over looks beautiful outside view. The Check in was smooth, Ms.Lovely was very helpful and courteous too during my stay. The room was good ( this time I have stayed in other room). The rooms are well maintained and very cleaned. Good part during my stay on the 1st day I have asked for extras water bottle and next day the another person from house keeping was cleaning my room and kept extra water bottle after making my room, I was shocked with their internal communications to take care of their customer. The breakfast was good as well. During my stay I have meet Mr.Samim who was very attentive to take care my breakfast, the food was good. I have seen couple of new faces around me but the standard of services are top notch.
Most important part is - I have seen they do maintained good protocols for registration documentation and Sanitizing  which post this pandemic many hotels are not maintaining.
In one line - must visit and we'll secure hotel Raajkutir must visit.
Thanks team, see you other time."
"We had booked 7 rooms for a wedding. The hotel premises is a well maintained property, however, the rooms are not. The beds are the most uncomfortable ones I have ever slept on. To add to this discomfort, the pillows were as hard as stone. No pillow menu was available. The water pressure in the bathroom was extremely low. The rooms lacked proper lighting. All yellow dim lights were so uncomfortable. Not at all a 5 star standard property. The reviews are totally exaggerated. Wonder why no one has given an honest review regarding the beds and pillows. The safe was also not working in 3 rooms. We didn't have so much time to call the technician and get it repaired, so din't use it.
There was dust everywhere on the side tables, the coffee table, the chair. The floors were also not mopped properly before check in. I doubt there was no sanitization done. 
We got the room cleaned only on one day and the entire garbage bag was left outside our room 102 for 2 hours. Ultimately, I had to personally call the house keeping staff and get it removed. Horrible experience with the rooms.
On the good note, the food was tasty with decent options but not at par with 5 star rated as they call it. We had buffet breakfast and lunch. The service is good, staff are friendly and well disciplined. Staff are quite helpful though. 
I gave 2 stars only for the courteous behaviour of the staff or else it's just a one star for the maintenance.
"
"Went for lunch at the East India restaurant. The decor was subtle and gave the feel of a zamindari house, from the moment you walk in. The menu is well thought out. Lot of old zamindar house kitchen treasures have been included,like the jaali kabab, pantheras, keema Baidi parotta(old moglai parotta).dungar chicken, Dacca morog polao, dakbungalow chicken.. each and every dish was, well, cooked to perfection. Staffs were well trained and Manobi and Dhrubo, explained the dishes very well, which really helps, when you are spoilt for choices.

Finally, my advice would be, please take time to enjoy the dishes. These dishes have travelled through time to be presented on your plate. So be passionate in savouring them and let your mouth experience the burst of flavours one single morsel at a time."
"What a waste year 2020 was and RajKuteer Wasted my 31st Dec 2020 night too.. 

Like “S” is missing from “S”wabhumi in pics below, same way , “S”mile was missing from the face of RajKuteer staff. 
They “S”crewed our NYE totally.. arrangements were “S”habby. They couldn’t “S”tand up to their commitments. 
Won’t recommend anyone to visit and waist your time / energy and money in this place as they have mastered for aweful experience.."
"Nice is an understatement. To be honest, I was a bit sceptical in the beginning since the restaurant is not inherently an old quaint zamindar mansion like other heritage resorts around Kolkata. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the attention to detail Rajkuthir has tried bringing in to the ambience of this new boutique hotel and restaurant. 
Coming to the food, we were beautifully swayed away into the nostalgia of Bengali Culinary heritage along with the influence of European culture. One must admire the Dhaka morog pulao in there."
We went to Rajkutir right after our marriage. The highlight of our visit was the candle light dinner arranged by the staff. The food was delicious and the quantity was more than enough. The service by Manobi Rakshit and chef Swarnendu was praiseworthy in particular. We will definitely recommend Rajkutir especially for couples who wish to spend some memorable time together.
"Sankhyadeep’s service at the bar was perfect, he knew the cocktails very well. The hotel’s overall service was good. Each and every precaution with respect to Covid was taken care of. I had good time."
"A few days ago i happened to attend a wedding at raajkutir. It was truly an amazing experience. The breakfast at the East India Room was heavenly. I am hoping to visit again specially of the beautiful courtyard. I would like to mention a few people who made my experience more delightful. Daniel in housekeeping was a really great. Your reception staff are also exemplary, lovely and sraban were really helpful. They are always with a warm and a friendly smile. Over all it was an amazing experience. I would love to visit again."
"Excellent surroundings, a Royal like experience however buffet options are limited...Special attraction all the sea foods barbeque like prawn, squid, salmon, Bombay duck, Pomfret etc
Cons: No mutton/chinese items."
"Pros: Awesome grand structure, absolutely spic n span & very spacious! Very courteous and helpful staff & service people! Very picturesque setting that one can spend time in leisure & be able to avoid the crowd & be safe during this corona pandemic! The vintage ambience is absolutely lovely. The cake shop & bar adds to the options apart from the East India Room restaurant.

Cons: Food & beverage quality is just average! Although the price is at par with any 5 star facility, the food leave much to be desired. Lets start with the beverages, We ordered some mocktails which were lacking in flavour, extremely sour & needed addition of sugar syrup repeatedly.

For starters we tried a lotus stem kabab, & for all we know it could have been any veg kabab which was slightly on the too salty side.
The fish & chips were very oily & the batter coated fish had loads of oil as you cut through it.
The chicken stroganoff was not bad, but nothing extraordinary. The chicken Pulao was nice & aromatic.
As mentioned earlier, the food was just about ok nothing great & surely did not match the ambience of the place.
So a must visit for the ambience, but do not visit for the food or you would be disappointed.
But service was extraordinary & we enjoyed everything else."
"It was amazing to spending our precious time on the eve of our 3rd anniversary at Raajkutir.  The ambiance is just something more then Royal. Great presentation of aesthetic in interior and exterior part. Restuarant staff's are master in sence of hospitality. Our experience is really really great and for that evening we felt extremely special.  Thank you team . 

Will suggest everyone to give it a try.
Aman and Manoj thank you both of you for making us felt really really special. 
Awesome staycation option in the town.

One suggestion: we tried Barbeque dinner buffet in East India room,so would request the managers to include some more specialities in the main course as well. Otherwise everything else is just perfect.  Thanks!"
The place gives a surreal vibe. Antique and within the city spread across acres. Very sanitary. Great staff behaviour and care. Food is exquisite. A true experience. Good rooms as well. Loved it. Must visit for a great experience within the city
"It was my third visit to this amazing place and as always, it has been an amazing experience. The newly opened barbeque night made it all the more enjoyable. The warm and friendly staff made us all feel at home. Special mention of Aritra who made all the necessary arrangements even on last-moment notice. Also, Sanjay welcomed us back with so much warmth and made sure that our meal department was superbly handled :D Looking forward to visiting again soon."
Stay at Rajkutir is an experience worth sharing. Very much within Kolkata still it provides you with serene and tranquil ambience. Gives you the feel of grandeur of kingly architectural beauty with all modern amenities. Staffs were all courteous and cooperative. Special mention of Shraban Chakraborty the front desk executive is compelling as he had been the one window solution for anything and everything.
"A fabulous place! Loved my time! Would be visiting more often! Manoj Manna was an absolute delight and he took care of everything with regards to the hygiene, food description and suggestions, about the place. It's a must visit and also a very quaint place to take a staycation!"
"Lipsmacking aromatic bengali dishes with amazing desserts to end the meal is a die hard reason to love the place. Apart from food hospitality and safety measures are best.
A happy visit for us, will definitely visit again."
It was an excellent evening spent in East India Room. Special thanks to Manoj. He was very courteous and informative related to the dishes served at this restaurant. The restaurant is following high standard of hygiene. The food was excellent and very fresh. 
"I was searching for a place close by where I can visit with my parents. Obviously with the pandemic, my anxiety hit the roof as far as safety was concerned. But the team at Raaj Kutir took care of everything, especially Aritra Malakar from the reservation desk.
.
Hourly fumigation of the property, no checkin post check out from a room for 72 hours, contactless check in, sanitisation of car and luggage at entrance, lip smacking food, huge open spaces, and loads of laughter with my parents is all that I remember. The staff at the property are so so polite and family like. They cater to all your requests. The complimentary breakfasts are freshly made as per order, which really stands out, unlike other properties where they serve you in buffet. 
.
Prices are a little premium but so so worth it if you are someone like me travelling with old parents. Thank you @raajkutir for putting all my concerns to rest🖤🤍
..
It totally lives upto being a Boutique Hotel with so much space inside that you do not feel confined or enclosed in a property. If you know what I mean...10/10 recommended."
"One of the best hotel in kolkata, Food qualities are very delicious ...
Staff's are very cooperative...
Specially Pinky Barman..  She is very helpful.. Thank You Rajkuthir Team for the amazing experience.."
"I fall short of words to describe the beauty of this place - be it the food, the comfort, the rooms, the decor - it's AMAZING!! What made it even better were the extremely courteous staffs with their smiling faces and relentless efforts to make our stay pleasurable. Special thanks to Mr. Aritra, for arranging our stay. Also, I would like to specially mention staffs like Sanjay, Dilip, Manabi, and others who always ensured that we are comfortable. Rajkutir is nothing short of BLISSFUL, in a word. It doesn't fail to provide the much-needed escape from the boredom we all are stuck with. We have been there twice already and would like to revisit soon!"
It was lovely place for outing and staying with family and friends ... we enjoyed a lot .. delicious food we njyng the meal 😋😋😋😋🥰🥰we will cm to nxt visit for sure... i want to njy nxt visit with your guidance 😇

Amazing hospitality. Great food. Nice rooms. It's perfect for a weekend getaway. The staff was super helpful and very accommodating. They have a very interesting menu and everything tastes really nice
"Very recently I did travel to this property to spend my good time with my family. I have Spend about 10k to get complete experience. Once I was check out I felt I have given more what I was expecting on 10k. 
Hotel check in process was quick and Aritra and Lovely was really helpful and courtesy. Our luggages was sanitized before it could send across to the room. Room was very nice and it was completely different from any other hotels. For guest safety they provide mask and sanitizer in room.
Evening we have enjoyed with traditional dance performance in hotel. Breakfast was nice and good we have enjoyed alot also the staff at restaurant are good.

Over all I give 5 out of 5. Thank you for your hospitality."
"Our visit to Rajkutir was overwhelming. The Banquet team did a wonderful job. The hospitality was unmatchable. All our guests had good thing to say about all.needleas to say the food quality has improved immensely from the time I used your place, whic was about over four years back. Would love to use your venues if opportunity comes. Thanks a ton."
"The property is aesthetically done and every corner is beautiful. Hospitality was amazing. Ms Lovely at the front desk was very helpful and accommodating throughout our stay that made the occasion we went to celebrate  even more special. Every meal was tastefully curated. The gentlemen serving and hosting us at the restaurant were very warm, I wish could name them."
"First of all I want to give them more than FIVE STAR.  I went here yesterday to celebrate my husband's birthday. It was a very nice experience. Thanks for the wonderful hospitality. special thanks to Sraban. He has been helping me all the time since I booked here. And Chef Swarnendu’s food was awesome. The ambience of the property gives us a very soothing factor. Everyone is very helpful, well mannered. I like it so much that I can't finish saying it. I shall recommend this hotel for everyone. MUST VISIT."
Stay with them at regular basis .very well handled in room dining by Simran Joshi .expeditious and a good job .All the criteria full filled and service was bang on time .Simran was a pleasure to deal with .
Excellent! The snacks and coffee are excellent and Ankita is knowledgeable and a kind and helpful lady. So is Anuska. The items are fresh and new. A tough competition to kookie jar. I liked the hazel nut coffee ☕.
"Nice comfortable place for business stay, good, professional, soft spoken employees, always ready to assist wenever required … big Shoutout to SIMRAN (inroom dining) you rock girl… keep up the good work."
"Had a great overall experience. Their spa and fitness facilities have always been outstanding!

Would like to mention Sneha, Anjali and Indra for the amazing hospitality and care that they had shown towards all the residents and making sure our stay was really wonderful"
"Great hotel. I stay here every time I'm in Kolkata. The rooms are clean, the gym and spa are good, and the restaurant is excellent. The property itself is large and isolated from road noise on the whole. You should eat at La Cucina if you get a chance. "
"Had the most mouth watering, scrumptious meal at La Cuccina in Hyatt Regency, Calcutta. I was very well looked after right from the moment I walked in and was assisted by Abhishek who made every effort to ensure my dinner was just the way I liked it. He was extremely kind and courteous and made my experience very memorable! Special thanks to Abhishek and the entire team of La Cuccina. Looking forward to many more visits!"

I was so at ease because of the help and understanding I received from her and her staff.. I hope Hyatt recognizes her potential as an employee. Thank you

"Although I had gone for all the four chaats but the banarasi tamatar chaat was the best. With all those spices and chutneys, it made my evening memorable. I still can't forget the taste of those bites!! 
Thanks to the team of Hyatt Regency Kolkata, especially Subhashish, Abhishek and Rahul for gifting me a wonderful evening!!!"
"I wisited RCGC with my team for RDPL celebration , i loved the aloo tikki ragra chat from Hyatt food stall it was very delicious and specially thanks to Chef debjit , subhasis and abhishek for making my evening special ."
This was a visit to meet my old friend and the hotel staffs made it wonderful experience. The staffs were courteous and helpful. The only feedback I have is for the restaurant (WestSide Cafe) to improve their service. That day there was too much of crowd may be due to some function and staffs could have managed the crowd better instead of guests waiting for their orders for more than average of 15 mins from live counter. 
I often stay at this hotel and find it suitable in every way. The In-room dining service is wonderful and an employee named Ms. Simran is very good in suggesting good food choices and fulfilling the orders meticulously. Laundry service is also excellent. I am thankful to the entire Hyatt Kolkata team.
"Best experience and happy working with them .....  surojit 
Chakraborty   the floor was very supportive with us and was helping us through out the event whenever we required thank you so muchh !!!  Hoping to work again"
Mr Giti Rout in laundry services undoubtedly repeatedly provide excellent services . Goes out of his way for customer comfort and pleasant stay . Staff is nice and friendly and hotel location and room view are good . 
The quality and taste of the food is excellent in Hyatt Regency. Ms. Simran was extremely helpful in making the choices. She not only makes suggestions which complement the food but also as per the palate of the customer.
"Even though stayed here many times, my last stay was really memorable. Special mention for Mr.Rajesh, who was the duty manager. He made sure that each and every need was taken care of from check in till check out. Irrespective of multiple functions going around the hotel , he still managed to get time to personally call and check everything was taken care of. And I also would like to appreciate the effort of in-room dining in charge Ms.Simran Joshi who in every possible way made sure that the best food was served.Even though the hotel was fully packed due wedding ceremonies, still she managed to serve the food of my choice and that too on time ! People like Simran and Rajesh are definitely an asset for team Hyatt !
Highly recommendable property ! 🙌🏻 "
"We really satisfied with our program. We need to give special thanks to Manosij Das, Surajit Bhowmik, Nabab Sohel Ansari for their extra effort to make this program success. We really thankful to them."
"Excellent. was there for a corporate event at Hyatt Regency which was handled quite well by the team . specially mention to Surajit Bhowmick, Chef Souvik , Chef Kartik , Asif and the entire team for such an well handled event ."
Nawab Sohail Ansari best bar tender service was fentastic all in one hotel staff and browmik well managed everything last but not the least bar tender was best when ever he had given me cocktail. Thanks and good wishes for him.
I like the food.i like the behaviour of Rohini the most.we r fully satisfied.want to visit again with my family and friends.wish to come in special days of my life......❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.The ambience of the restaurant is awesome.
"By far the best Italian restaurant in Eastern India.
Staff Abhishek, Nawal, Rohini and Chef Dola Singh will pull all stops to make your experience here something to savour everytime you think of it.
The food is addictive... Standards have been maintained such that loyalists have been NEVER skipping a weekend for over ten years!
The Sunday brunch is iconic, and is a club of its own.
Authentic tastes and fine flavours.... Something most new gen eateries haven't got right yet."
"Check in process was superb. Good Proerty. 

Later in night, I had to struggle to get the extra bed setup. I guess shortage of staff ! It was really annoying to wait for almost an hour in late night when you desperately want to crash in the bed. Improvement area."

"A fantastic hotel in terms of the service offered by exceptionally friendly staff. 
In terms of location proximity to the metro is a strong point-the hotel is located close to Salt Lake and Beliaghata is not far off. Close by is a shopping mall where you can spend a day.
The Netaji Indoor Stadium is just next door.

We were there for a month and had the opportunity to assess the hotel closely
Firstly some constructive feedback-parts of the hotel decor and furniture are dated and need of a refurb
This does not detract from the overall comfort that the rooms provide however and the bathrooms in particular are good with what I would describe as a really good wet room delivering an excellent showering experience which should be a much needed experience particularly if one is visiting in the summer
We were there is February and enjoyed hot showers everyday
The housekeeping staff stocked the bathrooms with shampoo and body wash gel and even provided dental kits when we needed this
The rooms were cleaned to a high standard and the linen was changed regularly
Special mention of Maninder,Manoj and Rehman who catered to our every request
The carpets and furniture could do with a refurb, but were comfortable enough and I didn’t miss my bed at all (I am quite fussy about this)
Breakfast is served in the morning and there is lots to choose from
We really relished the Indian breakfasts as we don’t regularly get this in the UK and I have to say that most of the food was delicious
The staff at breakfast were helpful courteous and very friendly and catered to our many requests
Special mention of Aman Pradyut Tanmoy and Ankita although all the staff were really hospitable
There are other dining experiences as well although we did not get the opportunity to dine in the other restaurants
The lobby staff were really helpful- Rajesh really helped us with a sticky situation in the next room- a newly married couple were rebelling way past midnight and he helped quiten then down and the problem did not recur
Bishal was very helpful as well
The reception staff gave us a touching farewell on the last day and this was even more special for us given that this month long visit to Kolkata was prompted by a medical emergency in the family
In short Hyatt provided us with a feeling that we were living with family and looked after us exactly with this feeling in mind
We have stayed in many fancy hotels in the world but have not come across such a wonderful bunch of people
Definitely will return
Ranjan Basu"
"After a very long time we visited the bar, use to be our place , I was very cherished that the place has not changed a bit same feeling we got 
Mr. Jit took good care of us starting from the drinks till the food , the service was very prompt 
Mr. Saikat also came to visit us nice to see him after a long time,
Will be visiting again soon"
Lunch at waterside cafe was amazing...there was so many options in buffet And each food tasted awesome.....after that credits goes to the cafe team specially mitesh who was too friendly with us he served me some fabulous mocktail named salty caramel espresso with was so good in taste...we will visit again
It was an great experience visiting Hyatt....Abhishek and Shabbir took care of us well with some delicious food....they made our evening so special worth remembering....whenever we visited here we felt like our own place...I would suggest everyone to visit here...
Kudos to the waterside team for making my birthday so special ..Hyatt regency kolkata is one of the best hotel in Kolkata to visit on special occasions they organise everything so beautifully...special mention to Saikat and mitesh who treat us so well ...The food quality and service was top notch....Thank you guys...a day to remember forever
"The Stay turned from Bad to good with the support of the staff, primarily Soumani. She was very helpful anytime I needed anything.  The first day the stay was pathetic as the A/C in the room was not working and the staff kept on insisting that it was error on our side in the way we were using the A/C. This was not the first time I was staying in a 5 star or not the first time I was using A/C. However the front end staff heard the concern and immediately changed the room next morning, and there was no other issues after that"
"I visited waterside cafe yesterday, anjali was a good buddie, shev was very  helpful and welcoming the ambience was really great. Loved it ❤️❤️, the experience was quite good, will recommend my friends"
In my recent stay at Hyatt Kolkata my experience has been amazing. The staff service is amazing. Special thanks to Simran and Chef Amandeep who made this stay more amazing by providing excellent quality of Service. I have been visiting the hotel since past one year and there is major improvement in food which is been cooked in buffet . I would recommend the hotel for anyone’s future stay.
"Thank you Simran for the wonderful hospitality. Food was very delicious and was made just as  what I had asked.
Excellent service and enjoyed the dinner alot.
Thank you once again will be surely visiting the hotel again."
"It’s was lovely  time I have spend here 
Aritro -he have served us in lovely way , every drink he made it was really refreshing.
Saikat- he is also arranged it so well .
Thanks so much for making. My day so special ❤️
Will visit again.."
"Went back to the Hyatt Kolkata after a long break. The staff at the Porch, front desk , housekeeping ( Mr Shoumyan) and in room dining ( Ms Simran Joshi) were very courteous. Food quality has improved. Great work ,keep it up!"
Chef dola Singh has been a wonderful chef...and he is very open to feedback one of the best chef in hyatt and we have seen his hospitality he is really good and the food is awesome in hyatt really recommend o fian and itian
"Far from home yet you don’t feel that you are not at home…special touch by the chef,the interaction with in room dining and the people who served hospitality was impeccable…special mention to Soumani and Rashmi for lovely Parathas…will see you soon…Thanks"
Had a pleasant stay at Hyatt Regency Kolkata. Good property with excellent service. Special call out to Mr. Rehman for taking care of my needs and going the extra mile to serve your customers. You indeed left a smile on my face.
"It was an excellent evening in Hyatt regency the setup was wonderful thanks for all this arrangement…Thanks to the hyatt team Mr. Kumar Shovan,Ershad Mullick,Saikat,Indra Ganguly,Aritro,Tanmoy and Sandipan …chef Amandeep and Uttam chef to make our evening more special….we would love to visit again…the food and service were really excellent . Kudos to team hyatt !!"
"I have been here a couple of times, and as always Hyatt lives up to the expectation. Along with having amazing rooms, the food is extremely scrumptious. Thanks to Simran, she was very kind at taking my food requests, willing to go out of her way, the food was delivered exactly how I liked it. 

Highly recommended place.

Thanks & Regards,
Shamoil."
Great IRD menu and food quality. Simrans assistance in suggesting the best items was much appreciated. Keep up the good work. The cheeze cake and chocolate pastry were the most enjoyed items. Cheers!!
"Had a wonderful outing with friends and our dogs! 

Aritro Das assisted us and he was outstanding! Very cheerful and attentive, even when he was handling multiple tables mostly on his own. 

Hyatt food is always good and it’s very nice that pets are allowed. 

The only two negatives this specific evening was 1. Not all food choices were available in the set menu. 2. The ambiance was not great. There were two other events going on in the same ground, three different music from each direction, all extremely loud. So it was very chaotic. We could barely hear each other speak."
"Stayed at Hyatt for a wedding. A beautiful hotel.  The GM and his team were amazing in all respects. The great attitude of the staff is something which is verbally absent in this part of India. The quality of food surpassed my expectations.  Banquet did was great which is quite difficult and seldom found even in the best of the hotels. 
The hotel does require a complete renovation of not only rooms but even public areas. If they can upkeep the hotel to international standards,  this hotel will stand out and give a run for its money to is larger competition. 

I congratulate the GM and management of the hotel for their endeavour to overcome the physical state of the hotel and still give a very satisfactory experience to their guests. 

I will love to recommend this hotel to entries"
"Well located in ( about 35 minutes from airport), very spacious hotel with ample facilities to include a tennis court, beautifully maintained garden by horticulture department around a stylish shaped swimming pool, surrounded by fountains. Location of Breakfast buffet and gym is awesome and faces the green. The lounge at 5th flor is class apart with a bird's eye view of the lavish hotel premises.

Cons: The rooms have a tinge of paint drops all over floor and walls as if uncleaned floor and walkway around the hotel within boundary of hotel if not taken care of.

Overall a nice experience for a short stay. "
One of the best time I've ever spend..foods are the best..food quality is good... One of the highly recommend restaurant..and obvio want to mention the behaviour of the staffs.. specially ms.priya who organised all things better way and her behaviour is so kind.. that thing made our dinner experience good. That was my second time I've visited with zero complaints.
Very good service and lavis food. Thanks to Mr. Surajit Bhowmik & Sabyasachi for their great service. Love for Hayatt . Love thai green curry. See you soon. Servi was awesome. Love love love love . Beautiful ambiance great Indian food .
"Attended hyatt regency kolkata for a friends anniversary event at regency lawn. Excellent service and food . Special mention to Surajit Bhowmik and Chef Debnath for the event .The mocktails were really refreshing . The asian counter , asparagus counter was really amazing. It was really satisfying to get really hot breads live made from tandoor fresh. Thanks to Asif for the lovely service."
"Impeccable food and very effecient service. The head chef Mr. Dola Singh took time out to attend to us, and was very friendly even during the rush hour of dinner time. Overall a very good experience for any sort of family/friends outing at the La Cucina restuarant."
"excellent service and hospitality

"surjit is so well mannered, warm and humble personality, Mr. sonu  is so helpful and polite person. They provide best service to us. You people made our trip so special and memorable. The food is very excellent."
"Polo Floatel Kolkata is the first ever hotel in India that floats over The Mighty Ganges, I would rather call it a massive ship with Cabins not rooms folks, inside the look and feel is simply marvellous. This was my first time visit to the capital of the state West Bengal - Kolkata and I checked into this beautiful place, the moment I entered the main gate in saw two gentlemen greeting me in the attire of security personnel’s and they were closing the gate and within seconds the train passed by and I could control to take the video and cannot believe it was passing just few minutes away from the main gate wow, post entering the premises you will feel like you are on a ship which is ready to cruise, the checkin was smooth and was assisted by ms. Komolika, mr. Samiran Mondal and ms. sudipta, post which I was again greeted by Mr. Gopal the security personnel inside the ship ☺️. The ship has 3 floors plus top amazing banquet hall along with beautiful place to sit and feel the breeze of Mighty Ganges. The scenic view of Howrah bridge and Vidyasagar Setu bridge is breathtaking. On the top I met few hotel personnel’s they were extremely friendly and polite, they helped me gather more knowledge of the place and it’s surroundings. I was thrilled by their passion and hospitality, and that assured me about the bright and future vision of the owner, a clear vision always cultivate sense of responsibility and mission for their employees and you guys are doing the wonderful job. This ship/hotel is situated at VIP area and you will see a lot of massive govt. head offices near by. The charm is more enhanced by the marvellous Eden garden cricket stadiums which is accompanied by small beautiful stadiums for upcoming cricket & soccer players. If you want to have fuchka aka Paani puri then don’t forget to visit princep street which is hardly 1 km from the hotel. And please do have English breakfast in flurys it’s amazing plus finger licking experience you will have. Rest there are many places around, like Park Street etc. you can roam around and have some tasty street food. Rest the place has good vibe and also there is boat ride and the costing is around 3-5k range you can explore this option to feel the tides of Ganga. I will attach few pictures for your reference, overall I stayed for 2 days and yes it a memorable experience, thank you hotel staff and Polo Floatel management team, definitely I will visit again !

Loads of love & support
- Paz"
"We went there in the evening to celebrate our mom's bday.
The open deck is simply amazing and is the best place in Kolkata to enjoy the riverside.
The view was amazing and so was the food. The starters were nice (potato wedges, naga chilli cheeze toast which we ordered). Hot cappuccino in the cool surroundings was refreshing and well made. There was thupka also in the soup.
The veg pizza with choice of any four toppings was thin and well done..
In the main  course we had north indian - it was super tasty and beyond expectations. 
We had also called for a live singer and stayed for five hours and had a lovely time throughout.  The deck was really well lit up and gave a festive feel after sunset.
Its a Great place to chill at sundown. They serve shisha on the open deck which one can enjoy with the view of the hooghly. They also have an indoor restaurant next to the deck with good sitting capacity.
Service was good and staff courteous.
The place has got a complete makeover after change in management and ownership and one can see the difference in food quality, the interiors and service. 
Definitely a place we would like to visit more often."
"I had visited the original Floatel several times and even hosted a party there while working in Kolkata some years ago. While most visitors appreciated the novelty of a floating hotel, the infrastructure was getting quite worn out. 

Lately, I was glad to hear that the property has been taken over and refurbished - especially because the new owners are the Polo Towers group. Having stayed in their flagship property in Shillong several times, I think highly of them. Hence my wife and I visited the renewed Polo Towers Floatel with high expectations – rather like meeting someone for the first time, having known both their parents! 

Our first impressions were quite positive. The reception area was attractively decorated and we were politely directed to the restaurant on the top deck when we said that we intended to have dinner. The décor and ambience were far better than they had been in the past. The whole setup looked vibrant and inviting. 

Since it was the weekend before Valentine’s Day, the hostess at the entrance of the restaurant offered us two choices for a buffet dinner: inside the restaurant and on the open deck outside it. Since it was a bit chilly, and the open deck was costlier, we chose to sit inside. The ambience was great and there was a marvellous view from the giant window near our table. 

Since no one came to our table for several minutes, we decided to help ourselves to the soup and starters. There was only one type of soup in the buffet – vegetable hot and sour. My wife declined it as she does not like very spicy stuff, but I ventured to try it and found that it was too hot for my tastes. Coming to the starters, the baby corn fritters were oily, cold and rubbery; ditto for the fried fish that my wife sampled. The main courses were quite lacklustre as well, except for the Thai style vegetables in coconut gravy. As for the desserts, the less said the better about the baked rasgullas. The ice cream was disappointing as well. 

While the food was below our expectations, the service was still worse. Although the restaurant had barely 30% occupancy, the servers chose to ignore us whenever we tried to attract their attention. After much effort, when a server reluctantly came to our table and we asked him for fresh rotis, he promptly passed on our request to a passing colleague, who chose to delay bringing our rotis till we lost all hope of ever getting them! By the way, the servers were dressed in light blue shirts and dark blue trousers which might have been intended to give a nautical appearance, but they ended up looking like disreputable security guards. Also, they had no name badges and so it was hard to distinguish them from each other. 

Incidentally, I discovered the source of distraction for the servers. When I stepped out onto the open deck to take a phone call, I found that uniformed servers were standing near the serving counter and happily puffing away on hookahs. I am a non-smoker and I do not have any objection if guests who smoke want to share their hookahs with the servers – but I find it intolerable that non-smoking guests seated in the indoor space get neglected because the servers on duty are continuously distracted by the lure of consuming tobacco on the deck. 

The worst was yet to come. While we tried to cheer up each other as we went through the disappointing meal and experienced the still more disappointing service, eventually we asked a passing server to get us the bill. Several minutes passed but no one responded. Finally, I went to the bar counter inside the restaurant where a credit card machine was visible, but the person manning the counter showed a marked reluctance towards using it. The charges per head were high, but since we had been told about them in advance, I cannot complain. However, I must emphasise that neither the food nor the service was worth the price – and if they had demanded a service charge, I would certainly have declined to pay it. 

As we were leaving, my wife called for the manager. After we had waited for several minutes near the exit, a man wearing a smart black coat put in an appearance. When we shared our disappointment with him, he heard us in silence with a wooden expression and did not offer a word of apology.

To conclude, I am prepared to give 4 stars for the hardware (i.e. the furnishing and décor), but no stars for the software (i.e. cooking and service). Go for the experience of dining on a real ship, but do not expect anything beyond the novelty factor – unless you want to indulge in the exorbitantly expensive pursuit of sharing a hookah on the open deck!"
"A truly nice place to  stay , on Anniversary we have stayed over this hotel, room is well maintained the Housekeeping manager Samiran took very good care of us on this event , I love to come back again and recomend others also for this property"
The location is the only USP of this place. The deck restaurant is great to spend an evening. But the experience of stay is not that good here. The rooms are small and crampy. The service is very poor. Even it is very hard to contact the reception. Foods are also overpriced.
"It was an amazing experience by ganga side, excellent ambience, service and food.
Diibya the sales manager was cordial and organised the event well, entire staff was helpful.
Highly recommended place."
"A quick stop at Floatel for no specific reason made my day a blissful one. I was low due to certain issues, wanted to spend sometime with self....a sudden visit...and a quality experience...that will surely last for long....as I watched the Sun plunging into the heart of Ganges for the day...I felt rejuvenated to the core..."
"It was a nyc stay,,hotel is in a nyc location and the hotel staff are excellent, special thanks to Mr Samiran ,Rita and Faruk from housekeeping who made my stay memorable. They made me fee like i am staying in my own home."
"Well it's a well known floating hotel on the banks attached to river Ganga..
The ambiance is so beautiful and relaxing.
The rooms have been beautifully furnished providing a graceful, yet homely ambiance for you to chill. Hotel has a strategic  location.
Anchorage hall can accommodate comfortably 200 people as they were in our guests list.
Food was not upto the mark as per standards of four star.
A great help and super effort was by the Banquet manager Mr. Dibya Tirtha Majumder many thanks to him. 
Breakfast was good , lots of variety on the menu, upper deck was awesome, feels like Titanic 
Over all a good deal."
Last Saturday I went to Floatel after almost three years. Loved the new renovated look of this place. The interior designs are awesome. The ambiance is fascinating. Enjoyed the beautiful sunset over the river from the open air deck. Loved the hospitality of Soumita. She was very helpful and courteous. Will certainly visit this place again...
"Must visit.. such a calming environment that one forgets one is in the heart of Kolkata's CBD, Dalhousie. Food is very nice, a special feature is their boat ride picnic which is super cool and absolutely insta-worthy."
"Had visited Kolkata on a personal trip...

Had heard about the place from my colleague, so jus went to try on... And the place didn't disappoint me at all..

Even exceed the expectations of mine. 

Really like the Chicken tikka and Prawn Prepration done by Chef.

Really appreciate the efforts from Mr. Sanjiban.

Will recommend other to try the place with amazing view and great Food."
"Right from the beginning to checkout.. the entire experience was simply splendid. The extra bit of personal touch was all throughout present. Got a river facing room without asking for it. Very courteous staffs, awesome authentic food and immaculate professionalism even at the odd hours. Highly recommended. I would like to appreciate entire fo team, specially komolika and pooja they were very helpful during my stay. Thanks a lot."
It was a very good experience.  Wonderful  boat ride. Sona and Subhas helped us and made this boat ride more easy for me and my family. The food was also very nice.Everyone  should visit once. All-over great experience.❤
"The entire staying was very good.. Meeting with Pratyusha was very good, we come to know about entire arrangements specially for couple. So we obviously plan for coming again and also will tell our friend to come either with family or their partner mainly who are newly married.."
"Stay was good, staff behaviour was also good, front desk people nature I liked that they are very helpful and supportive they help me for sometime which was my personal problem. Komolika and sudipta both girls from front office seriously awesome."
"Ambience was very good......
Awesome services. Staff are very helpful. Thanks sudipta and kamolika for your friendly nature and helpful attitude. I want to visit again with my family. Food was really awesome."
The boat ride was amazing. Special thanks to subhas kapat for helping us. The view of Ganga is very good from the restaurant in the 3rd floor. The outer deck has a very good ambiance and they are even going to open one more area at the top which has swings and chilling stuff
"Very nice experience

Wonderful experience with you all especially Mr. Sona and his team. Beautiful views and lovely snacks. Time stands still at an experience like this. Wish it lasted longer. Recommend it for everyone who wishes to spend some quiet time
"We were a group of 8 friends stayed at this property with our spouses .The rooms ( Riverview Heritage & Riverview Cabin ) were excellent. They give you a feeling of cruise ship. However when you are in a group  it is quite obvious you would want to hangout together, for which except the restaurant there was no other place open for guests. So the choice was either you stay in your room as a couple  or have food together as a group in the restaurant. The most disturbing part was a ) they have plenty of open deck area available but for some reason didn't allow us...and b ) they have room with private deck which was comfortable for 6 to sit and 8 can also squeeze in...but at the time of reservation we were told the private deck is good for 4 persons to sit. Food  quality was excellent and special mention for Subhrajit & Sudipta at front office and Soumita and Sanjivan Maity and team at the restaurant for their service."
"I felt like a king!!!
"" I felt that I was staying in my own house ""
Extremely extremely super service....
Food, staff, many more things I have no words for describe..we were checked upon by housekeeping supervisor Miss Rita in morning regarding our stay..she was amazing and very attentive..overall excellent experience😊😊"
"Well on my 3rd Anniversary I took my Wife for the special 1 hr Boat Ride provided by Floatel. Its an exciting experience, good food and awesome views compliments the overall experience. Sona was responsible for taking care of us and he did a great job."
"Staying at  hotel Polo Floatel, The property is exceptionally well located, it was almost like staying in a cruise ship with bigger rooms, Staff was cooperative specially Komolika helped us a lot in Checking out, while Ibrahim helped us in checking in smoothly."
"Sona really made our experience hospitable & worthwhile. It was a delightful morning with a mesmerising view, delicious desserts & great tea! 

The booking procedure by the respective staff was also absolutely hassle free. Would definitely recommend."
"It was a great pleasure to be here. Lovely Ganges backdrop added to the beauty of the place. Great ambiance great service and great food. Special care taken by arpan, Riya srikumar joy and Suman........"
"Excellent support staff and quality food..Service by Arpan, Riya, Srikjmar , Suman and Joy were outstanding ...... I will strongly recommend all to visit here and will be here back again..Location is always great and so as the hospitality"

Best place to enjoy the sunset over the Ganges. Celebrated my brother's birthday. Food was good but more options in the snacks Menu is required. Hookah is available but they have not yet received the bar license. Service is good.
Stay was very comfortable. View was just amazing. Hotel staffs were very helpfull. The receptionist girl Sudiptaa was also very helpful.. She upgrade my room just for my one request. Basically my first time floatel visit experience was soooo excellent. Restaurant also well decorated. Morning buffet breakfast decoration was very nice along with service
"I will give 5 start for foods, hotel decoration, safety. Above all their staff hospitality..its too politely..i want to mentioned some of their name Arpan, Riya, Sona. My wife and me visited there for our second anniversary night spent. In one words its beautiful place for us."
"Awesome experience with lovely ambience & Arun/Tapas were of great support. Made the Anniversary really special with Candles & flowers. The food is delicious, staffs are courteous & ambience is scintillating. Must visit. Rooms are clean with nice views of Hooghly river & Sunset."
"The experience has been very good. Very good hospitality. 100% cleanliness and social distancing followed. 

Food was good. Alcohol was not been served.

Fish fry was excellent. Also deserves mention for veg pizza and lemon grass chicken.

We were served by Mr Tapas."

Very nice ambiance. Great place to be with family..Sona the staff served as well . Great choice of food suggested by Sona . Good service . Food was good . Mocktail was tasty ..Soft music playing in the background
We had a sumptuous Sunday Brunch. Price was very reasonable and I specifically mention personalised service of Sona and Arpan. By the side of River Ganges it is in an ideal location for spending some quality time with family and enjoy the food.
"Excellent service by Sona and Arpan..
Food spread was good both veg and non veg.
Will visit the once again with family.
But should have more variety of Mocktails and beverages..
Although enjoyed my Sunday🙂"
We visited Flotel today for Buffet Lunch... Wonderful experience it was...The ambience is awesome so the food..Sona  our serving person was very efficient and good..Like to visit here again.Like to visit here for breakfast someday
"Excellent experience and delicious food, well and decent service and house keeping , must visit place and can come to enjoy view of hoogli river and nearby places. Rooms are neat and well maintained.I enjoyed my experience here.
SONA ji service is really nice, thanks"
"Room booked: Suite with balcony
1. Despite keeping my arrival time pre-notified, the room was not ready. We were made to wait for around one and half hours even after the hotel's official check-in time before our room was ready;
2. Room was called ""Suite""! It was just an average room. Bed was very small for a family of 3 i. e. me, my wife and infant daughter.
3. It appeared that there was no regular upkeep of the room with dirty lighting panel, damp walls, balcony sliding door didn't shut properly and was very difficult to move;
4. TV wasn't functioning;
5. One chair in the balcony was rickety and the balcony was dirty as well with dust on the railings.
Overall, it was a very poor quality room which was being sold as ""Suite with balcony "".
Only good part was that the hotel manager was courteous and acknowledged that he had a new team who are still being trained on the job."
The ambience is very good. Especially the service offered by sona and Tapas wss very overwhelming. Food is  very good and yummy. I would like to come back again. The areal view is very awesome. Satisfied
"Visited Poloflotel for the first time . 
Had a great sundowner lunch with the view of Ganges and amazing foods with seesha. 
The service and hospitality is out of the world . 
Special thanks to Mr Sona, Mr Raj and Mr. Shree."
"Its an amazing place, with best view of ganges, the food quality is good,

Sona Adarsh, Faiyaz  and Sree Kumar along with others.

Had a great time with my family. Very nice service. Nice ambiance by the River. Lemongrass chicken which was recommended to us is a must try. Highly recommend this place to everyone who would want to have a good time with friends and family on open. Sona and others served us and took us around the property.

Staff beheaviour was good. House keeping service were excellent specially from Chandan Mondal who attended our room. But the rooms were not well maintained and a makeover/renovation is definitely needed.
"Breakfast is decent. Don’t experiment much is my suggestion.

Eggs preparation - Scrambled, Omelette , Uttapa is good and a safe bet to order.

Sona and Jay from Restaurant staff are helpful and friendly. 

The security guard for room is a Kishore Kumar fan and welcomed us with a beautiful Kishore Kumar song!!

Rooms are smaller than we thought though we have the biggest room available with Private Deck."
"Food is excellent here and Sona and jayakrishna the crews were really humble and nice, they served us very well and I enjoyed the ambience. They have great desserts also. Also you should try their gajar ka halwa in the morning it's yum."
"Good hospitality by staff and good food bt little bit high price
The location is jst awesome
Atmosphere and ambience is great.
We njoy the 31st night with live music and
Happy to stay with my family.."
Sat on the deck and the ambience was great! Our server Arpan and Riya and Adrash and sreekumar were very professional and sweet. The food--boat fish and the coffee--with hints of cinnamon--were a treat! Would definitely come again!...
Visited Calcutta after two years from the Netherlands qnd had an amazing time with my sister. Riya and Arpan guided us to the open deck with a view of the river and nice music. The food and drinks were delicious! Would definitely visit again with more friends.
"An amazing celebration of the mother and son duo on the stacation vist at Polo Floatel.

The deckroom the fantastic food the impeccable hospitality was worth a 3 cheers and not to be missed.

The pictures say it all...

Thanks a bunch to Sayanti Sabeer Sreekumar the entire kitchen management headed by Chef  Gautam and the lovely table attendant ...the Captains Arun Joy Kopert .

Kudos to the entire team!"
Really a nice hotel. Inside the ship decoration was very beautiful. Rooms are little bit cozy but we'll decorated. Staffs are very polite and well mannered. Sudipta and komolika both the girls are very sweet and very helpful. Thanks both of you.. you are guys suggest me a good view room
"I have been planning this stay for some time now , and could finally get my wish fulfilled thanks to my wife’s birthday which I thought of a surprise visit to this heritage property in the heart of the city of Joy.

I booked the Heritage Room with a Private Deck and the room was beyond my expectations, absolutely decked , neat and clean , and yes the private deck was the icing on the cake where we spent most of the time.

Food is pretty scrumptious..and if you book a table @ The Bridge ,  you get a lovely view and an open sky..

Boat ride is a must , preferably sunset ride is the best , all safety protocols followed, sanitised, snacks and tea offered on the boat in heritage boxes would surely make you feel special.

Coming to service- it is top notch , greeting and wishing you with a smile always, every body would jump into to make your stay pretty worthy.

Special mentions to Sourav Mitra , Srikumar Bhattacharya, Sayanti , Soumita , Subhash Kapat  and Mr Sabir , thank you for the amazing service…"

Nice place with excellent service (Mr.Sona and Mr.Suman) .The ambience was very nice. We ordered fish fry and penne pasta in white sauce. The food was excellent in both quality and quantity. Overall very satisfied.

Basically I visited at Kolkata for business purposes and I had stay at Polo Floatel. Stay was Such a wonderful and comfortable. All Staffs are well mannered. I had like to give a special thanks to Ms Sudipta who was in reception only. She was also very helpful and polite. Over all I want to give 5/5 rate to Floatel.
It was a wonderful experience. Staff was very nice and welcoming. Very fine snacks and drinks are served during the ride. Absolutely recommend to take the ride during sundown to see Calcutta in beautiful light. Five stars
"Beautiful experience on the Ganges with great food and a personalised nauka ride! Great service by Subhash and Sabir! Great for an experience of the sunset in Calcutta, the food was delicious and served on the boat!"

"The floatel just as name suggests is afloat on hoogley river with scenic view . Able to have a good time with family. Its very serene ! And enjoyed a lot with good food at the hotel. The hospitality of hotel staffs arpan, riya, and sabir were very welcoming."
"Love the place... One of the best place in town... Arpan is very smart guy who earned this review with him hospitality... Other names to mention is Restaurant Manager Suman, Tapas and none other than Soumen Halder, General Manager and my old friend... Food is excellent... Service is top notch..."
"It’s been renovated well. However, there is no way you will be able to sleep at night. It’s got wooden walls and anyone in the whole floor opening or closing a door is going to make it feel  Like it’s happening in your room. It’s just way too noisy. 
Also there is no area apart from the room and the restaurant where you can hang out. It’s a unique place and you are just Better off going there for a meal rather than staying over night.  
There should have been a private area for in-house guests. 
Breakfast spread is average but the service is good."
I like the ambiance and arrangement is nice and exotic. Liked the taste of food. Both of us have really enjoyed the stay and brunch  at  Floatel. Thanks to Suman and his team. (Arpan. Riya.Sona and Joy)
"Great food, excellent hospitality and stunning views! Grateful to the restaurant crew particularly Soumita and Sona whose care made our dining experience all that more special. Highly recommend a visit!"
"Ambience is very nice.. and the food quality is also decent. Sona, dharmendar and Arun was very nice to us. They served us the food and treated us very well. We are very satisfied with their services."
"Great Ambiance  as well as quality  of food . Great service by Sona, Jay and Arpan . The rate was reasonable  and the place is very classy. The place was very nice.restaurent manager Mr Suman also very nice person."
"Lunch was excellent , food quality  100/100, good music and cleanliness  also,  great service  by Riya, Arpan,  Suman restaurant  manager  they take  care of us and Riya have good smelling, 
Thank you so much.."

"When searching a suitable place to arrange a family get together and banquet on 27th November 2021, to celebrate my son’s marriage, Polo Floatel fascinated me most by its convenient location and unique identity of being a hotel on a barge, floating on the Kolkata’s ancient lifeline, Ganga. 

My guests were just a select hundred in number and so, from among five options Polo Floatel offered me, I hired their “Compass hall & deck”, about 2500 sq ft combination of half AC hall and half open deck which matched my requirement best. I also booked two river-side sunset cabins to serve as retiring rooms for any of my guests if so be needed.

The occasion created a lasting impression among my guests. The ambience of the place was unparallel. Sales Executive Miss. Sayanti Das coordinated the whole program, starting from the introductory talks at the front desk a month ahead, through finalizing the menu by conferencing with Cheff Mr. Sujan, upto personally supervising the event till 10 pm on the date of the occasion, by teaming up with Mr. Sabbir, the highly efficient in-charge of the venue. No word of praise can match their service.

Ours was a traditional Bengali family event and the full course dinner, comprising 23 items from welcome drink to desserts, charmingly harmonized with the taste of my guests. Qudos to Cheff Mr. Sujan."
"Food is extremely good.good ambience.staff are friendly .special mention to Sabir,rioia and Arpan.nice and cosy place.Good for couples.winter time is the best.open space also.feels awesome in this winter."
"Good place to visit....nice ambiance...tasty food and staffs was very carefull specilly riya ,arpan, sweety, sabir , priyanka and dharmendra . They are too good person ... 
 Breakfst was too good speically choclate milkshake"
"The food, service, music was extremely good, would love to visit again with friends. The view was breath taking. The staffs behavior was very courteous and Soumita gave us one of the best seats on the deck. Loved it!"
Its a wonderful stay at the hotel. The room was nicely decorated in heritage style and also the lobby and the restaurant all are nicely maintained. Food is a little expensive though but thats worthy on a place like this. Would like to come again.
"Centrally located. Rooms are good. Had a great family time. Great service provided by Soumita, JoyKrishna, Suman. Food was also fairly good. They arrange additional boat rides etc on request. Overall, great experience."
I had a wonderful experience while having lunch in Floatel restaurant. Quality of food and ambience were both fantastic. Treatment that I received there from the staff was unprecedented. I recommend this place. Specially thanks to Riya and Jay..
"Floatel has recently undergone a renovation and it has given the property the much needed facelift. The decor alongwith the plush furnishings give a contemporary chic vibe. The river view rooms have great view of the Ganges and the iconic Hoogly bridges. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay thanks to the superb hospitality of Mr. Chandan Mondal who promptly catered to all our requests and Ms. Sudipa at the front desk for her the warm and helpful attitude.
The food and breakfast buffet spread was impressive as well.
A bit on the downside, the rooms are small.  However, the view being the major drawing point compensates for it."
"It has been a wonderful experience. Team Floatel has created an enchanting experience especially for a beautiful boatride with all the exquisite amentities with a blissful dinner service with plethora of food options for all kind of tastebud creating a wholesome wonderful evening and great experience. Thank You very much Ms.Soumita, Mr.Abhijit, Mr.Danish, Mr.Suman for this wonderful experience."
"The lemon grass chicken & Tigershrimp stired fry and pink elephant mocktail  we tried over there it was such nice taste 
Soumita hleping alot of suggestion. Thanku flotel for our lovely evening 
 This is best place we ever had"
"Being locals, we've never actually stayed here before. But the Grand being such an iconic institution, we decided to spend a night there and celebrate my mother's 75th birthday.
They made it very special for us indeed. We had balloons and festoons and roses and cakes....
The entire works in fact.
And the Grand is certainly a very charming place, no mistaking that. The building itself is a class apart. It has a lot of atmosphere. I especially loved the slightly eerie feeling I had after sundown, every time I looked at the shuttered original block. It was a place to let your imagination run wild.
But I would still say that all in all it was less than my expectation. But then in all probability the fault (if there be a fault at all) lies not in the hotel but in my exaggerated expectation.
So..... yes.  it's a five star."
We had an amazing time at Baan Thai on our first anniversary! Our server for the day was Asif & he was super courteous & suggested fantabulous dishes for us! All were super nice but a special shoutout for the papaya salad...it just blew our minds!
"Our experience at Oberoi Grand Kolkata was absolutely phenomenal. The highlight of the stay was the breakfast especially the amazing chef ; Satvik who prepared the Banana French toast and the courteous and empathetic staff members - Nilanjan, Subham , Chahat , Asif and Kashangwon and a host of other members. 

Given a chance , I would love to stay with them every time I am in Kolkata. Highly recommended and Would rate it exceptional for their services."
"If you want to experience true luxury you should visit The Oberoi Grand. I went to Baan Thai for a family dinner and the food was amazing but what made the difference was service staff. Ishali, Asif and Asif thank you for such a memorable experience."
"Great food and really spectacular service, especially by Asif. Definitely recommend coming here for some great dining experience.

Ambience is very nice. We had starters and mains, the meat was well cooked and overall great taste."
"This heritage hotel is a living piece of Kolkata history as so much about the city.  Wonderfully located, this classically elegant property is a pleasure to stay in. The staff are friendly and helpful. And do make time for Mr. Sircar’s property tour if you are a fan of history. He the longest serving staff at the hotel and is an institution in his own right!"
Everything was so beautiful. Starting from the great location amidst all the shopping hauls. Must visit if you are a travel and shopping freak. Starting from checkin to checkout Vicky was always there to help with all our needs. Thanks to him for the humongous packed breakfast  he left for us.
"Well this feedback traces back to my wanderlust visit in the property last to last week where I dragged myself to the The Bar hoping to have some drinks and head back home like always. But what makes me sit down and write this essay is my introduction to Vicky at the Front Desk. I came up with the most stupidest question and alas Vicky caught my attention by not answering it so stupidly. He walked me to the bar and cut to next half an hour I was 3 down. He really is a professional and knows his skills. Great speaker,  great company, great product knowledge, great ambassadoring skills. He even showed me around the hotel. As promised, shall definitely come back more and more often. Big shootout to Snehail and Nilanjan at the bar who were just awesome.

Love and support
Jacinta Tigga

"

It is an absolute pleasure to be back at hotel.

Firstly and foremost my very special thanks to Mr. Mayan Dhawan , who consistently tops my list👍🏼👍🏼

He fortunately is acting as the General Manager of Hotel, Undoubtedly He is the most deserving Candidate for same, Hats off to his down to earth nature, His team feels super relaxed in his presence.

Housekeeping means Mr. Belal Hamza for me, He round the clock is available and make sure that nothing goes wrong.

Agnelo , Koushikee , Sidharth Jha made sure our special mention.

At the Restaurant Ms.Ishali, Mahipal, Tanishka ,Debdut , Ronil

Special Thanks to Mr.Sarkaar"
"We had an array of items, both veg and non veg, ranging from soup to starters to main-course. Yummy! The Lotus stem, spring rolls, Tom yum soup, rice and Thai curry! A neat whiskey sour to go with as well. 

Thanks Tenzing for your patience and service! Must visit!"
"Mr Mayan and his entire team including Gurpreet and Chef Pappu Singh were brilliant. They really looked after me, and made me feel at home looking into the tiniest details. Mr Sayantan was specially helpful  and of course the Oberoi experience was immaculate as usual. What an awesome property, the pool side was like sitting in Goa and the Thai cuisine was to die for. 

Cheers 🥂🥂"
"amazing food, the sushi and pizza was exquisite. The person serving us was named abhishek and he was super helpful and recommended some extremely good dishes. The ambience was very nice and overall it was an good experience😄"
"We came for our 1st night after marriage and the team had made our stay extremely special with customised photo frames, room decor, cake etc. Vicky, Debolina, Rahul Sharma, Yangam, Alena were amazing and a special mention to Soumajit for arranging the most special stay ever for us. Thank you so much."
Our post covid lunch couldn’t have been better. Tenzing deserves a special mention for being super helpful and making it special for us.  Some preparations were better than the best I had in Thailand..
"Had a wonderful time at the Oberoi Grand, Kolkata in Feb 2022. The hotel easily combines the old world charm with modernity.
Great food and wonderful courteous staff  (Thanks to Chef Veeram and co). Thoroughly enjoyed breakfast on all the days there.
The front office too was very accommodating and handled our unique situation will deft understanding (note: we were in a secured bubble!).
Housekeeping and laundry services were exceptional and efficient. Special mention of Swetha Vishwakarma. She is very good at her work. Very affable, she made every effort to help out and to assist in every situation. A big thanks to her! 🙏

Would very much like to return to Oberoi Grand as soon as possible."
"Excellent experience at the Oberoi as usual.

Food was great. The traditional Ice Cream Sandwich is a classic and a highlight. The service was exceptional - in particular Debdutt was very friendly and helpful."
Thankyou for making our stay so comfortable and special mention to Ms. Gurpreet from front office for being so warm and making our stay so specia. I must say she is an asset to this property and i will surely visit soon
"Been there for the first time. It’s an awesome place to dine in..  all the foods are quite good.. the boy, Mr Tenzing took a very special care for us.. service was prompt.. too much helpful also suggested the menu.. worthy of a visit.."
Loved my recent stay at the hotel. I happen to stay at The Grand only because it was closest to my work area but it turned out to be the best decision. Starting from welcome to farewell the guys take care of every single thing. Thanks to Anjali who assisted through checkin and Vicky during checkout. He even got me the same room at good deals during busy period. Everybody else is great and does wonders in bringing a smile to their guests.
Special mention to Vicky to make our stay so so special starting the start. The rooms was breathtaking and nothing could have marked a better start to our stay. The breakfast was serene and we absolutely were full till lunch. Planning to visit soon whenever travel permits. Shall be looking out for Vicky always for his over the masks smiles.😊
"Loved the food as always! Baan Thai has forever been a favourite, and kudos to them maintaining their standards. Loved the pad Thai and Grilled tofu. Special thanks to Asif and Khitish for the great service."
"Back home after a short holiday last week at the Oberoi Grand, Calcutta. “Atithi Devo Bhava” seems to be the guiding philosophy of the staff. The four of us experienced this -  with those we met face to face, and the many who worked behind the scenes. Ms. Apoorva, Ms. Gurpreet, and others at the front desk welcomed us with a warm smile. Right from our initial request for connecting rooms, to more mundane needs like a yoga mat, were met. The restaurant staff were flexible to our desires – Chef Anna, Ms. Muskan, Mr. Abhishek, Mr. Sanejelo - to name a few – they were all uniformly attentive (pardon us - we do not remember other names ). Also, appreciate the services of Mr. Gidian of the housekeeping department. Mr. Mayan Dhawan took time out of his busy schedule to answer our queries about other Oberoi properties. And of course, the very amiable Mr. Amitava Sarkar gave us an informative and engaging historical tour of the hotel. Thank you all.  
 If you are visiting Calcutta, do explore the option of staying at the Oberoi."
"Excellent service, hospitality. A very friendly and war approach from the staff side, especially Mr. Debdut.
He gave us a very comfortable time right from the start in choosing the best to all the suggestions and friendly trip advices. Thanks Oberoi."
"The food was excellent.
We went for a lunch outing with family. 
And nothing  we ordered on our own. Our staff Ankit was kind enough to help us order and each food item that was ordered was great.
Definitely a thumbs up for every aspect of my dining"
"Great food. Great ambience. Khitish recommended some good dishes and took care of our requests. Very friendly staff. A must visit for people visiting Kolkata.
From cocktails to soup to starters all were superb. Even the desert was nice. All in all great experience."
"Excellent experience at the 363 restaurant. Special mention for Debdoot and Guni Khushi. Debdoot was very kind to suggest us the perfect food items to select from the menu, recommend heritage food items and the right cocktails to have. They also specially served an anniversary cake, making it special, would absolutely recommend giving a shout out for debdoot and Khushi if you visit this place, you would know what to have exactly and also have the most warm and welcome experience!!! Thank you team."
"The food was top notch. The ambience and the service was really great!! Our requests and comfort were well taken care of.
The person who attended us was Abhishek and he was very hospitable. 
I also received this surprise gift for my birthday!!"
Very well serviced by debdut & subhangi very pleased with their service food is awesome ambience was very good overall decoration is very eye catchy.debdutt having a broad knowledge of wine that is very impressive.
"I couldnt stay in the hotel as it was full, but we went there for dinner at their poolside restaurant and it was fabulous. The food, the ambience, the weather, everything was perfect mix. I am especially touched by Debayan who served us during the dinner and he was exceptional. So kind, friendly and thoughtful. He ensured that our dinner was most memorable experience of Kolkata trip."
My stay at The Oberoi Grand was immensely wonderful and lovely. The hotel is literally Grand and the interiors are so warm and pretty. Loved the food. Vicky was very very helpful at the reception with my queries. Shall visit again definitely.
Had a wonderful time at Baan Thai. The food was excellent and so where the people. The stir fried mushroom is highly recommended as is the grilled prawns.  Had a very nice time. Would love to come back
"The food was good - the appetizers were great, the lobster was good and the pad Thai was a bit too Indianized. Wine was ok. The service (by Tenzing) was great. The Grand hotel itself is beautiful and it’s worth going there just to see the grandeur (no pun intended) of the place."
"We throughly enjoyed our stay and the wonderful hospitality that the staff provided in true Oberoi fashion. Checkin was a delight with Arpan and his staff. We enjoyed the service at breakfast. Our room was serviced by a very courteous team. Syed Sultana from housekeeping left us a gracious note and a thoughtful book as a gift.
A special treat was the tour of the property that we received from Amitava Sarkar. Mr. Sarkar, who is a true gentleman, told us the story of the hotel while showing us some of its hidden secrets. His enthusiasm was infectious, we too are now Oberoi fans (beware Taj)."
"We came over expecting a pleasant family lunch, and we had an amazing time and some extremely delicious cuisines. Special thanks to Debdut Mukherjee for his extreme support and amazing service.
It has been an extreme pleasure being here and looking forward to future visits."
"Classic Oberoi service and hospitality - most thoughtful staff from the front desk to the housekeeping- will be back soon!
Koushikee Prerona and Aaron (the concierge) made sure we were comfortable. The housekeeping surprised me with a replenishment of toiletries- great gesture!"
"Have stayed in some of the best Oberoi hotels but this one will always be special being closer to home. Welcome letter/email from the General Manager Mayan Dhawan mentions “welcome home” and I totally agree with it. Being one of the iconic hotel of the city even the chain, the hotel and each and every staff showcase and deliver the very essence of the city, the very culture & tradition of the city. Without forgetting the brand everybody takes special effort to give a personal touch to ensure that you feel as good as being at home. 
The front desk team is not only professional but creates a comfort level, building great rapport with guests and family. The team is super helpful in going out of there way to help even with requests like suggestions and booking outside the property. 
The fantastic room reservation team and Varun Sharma needs a special mention for extending all possible help when it’s required.
In room dining and Three Sixty also matches with the expectation and delivers at top level each and every time I have visited. The young energetic super friendly engaging team - it’s always feel good time visiting the restaurant. Apart from the service, the food does not disappoint either. 
Maintaining such an old iconic hotel is not an easy task and the house keeping and maintenance team is doing a great job. Nice clean safe rooms even the common areas are kept spick and span.
Lastly as they say the first impression is the last impression, the concierge team just ensures that you are warmly welcomed and enter the hotel with a nice feeling…"
Best Thai food that I have had!!! We had soups- Tom Yum and Tom Kha. Both were wholesome and authentic. We followed ot with a pad Thai and some chicken (don't remember the name but deliciously crisp and saucy). We were treated to some Fuyong and some water spinach which were lip smacking!! The citrus cheesecake was flavourful and nice. Our server Tenzing was simply amazing with smiling eyes (he wore a mask!) Overall a delightful experience!!! Definitely recommend!!!!
"My stay at the hotel was absolutely comfortable and overwhelming. Had it not been my work, would have loved to stay a bit longer and explored but I guess that means I shall be visiting soon. Immensely in love with the people and food of Calcitta. Thanks to Vicky at the lobby who helped me in reservation and made it even more comfortable."
We stayed here a short vacation with our kids and we absolutely enjoyed our stay thoroughly. The hotel made sure to take care of us and the small ones starting from checkin to checkout. Loved the small small gifts left behind in the room and goodies we receive at the breakfast/dinner table. Everybody is great and cheerful but would love to mention Vicky for gifting us the hamper during checkout. That was such a nice gesture and we shall cherish us till our next visit.
"Have stayed here for couple of times now and everytime it is better than the previous one. Absolutely in love with vintage room, quiet environment, great food, great breakfast options. The staffs are great and now they even just understand what I need. Would love to mention Vicky at the Front Desk who takes care of all my needs."
"We came to celebrate my parents' anniversary, and the meal and services were excellent. Everyone was extremely well mannered and hospitable. The staff made our stay overall very memorable. Gurpreet was with us from the beginning of the trip and took care of our every need."
"Every single person is so passionate about their work and I had so many Aha moments in my two days stay here.. They have an extra eye for detail which makes them so special and it's a royal treat to stay here..

Must stay for the grandeur and more so for all the warmth they shower"
The food at grand is amazing. Debdut was our food advisor..and the dishes he suggested were excellent we thoroughly enjoyed the food..a 5 on 5 for staff behaviour so hospitable and helpful..!! Waiting to drop in soon.
We came to Baan Thai to celebrate my parents' anniversary. The meal was excellent and the service was even better. Nayanika was lovely and brought us dessert on the house. The experience was fantastic and we will definitely be back.
"I met Debdut and i want this guy to be recognized publicly because he is phenomenal. He was smart, caring and knowledgeable about the food and drinks. He just had his friendly demeanor about him and made my day. 

He is the best waiter i have ever had in India. 
Food was also great which was suggested by him. In kolkata if i ever have visit again will come to this place ( Oberoi Grand) only so that i can meet Debdut again. I wish him a great success in his life. 

Thank you so much Debdut for your exceptional service. You made my visit memorable at this place."
"Lovely dinner at the pool side.food was too notch. Especially the Eggplant parmesan was outstanding. Fabulous service by Nilanjan. Thank you for the lovely caramel espresso martini!! Anniversary well spent. 

Thank you for a brilliant night. "
"It's a bit odd, that you stay in a 5-star property with family in the same city where you live. But I decided to plan my anniversary the same way. I choose Oberoi Grand Kolkata. This property is a heritage of Kolkata. It was my childhood dream also. 
The experience was super, starting from check-in to check-out. 
The food was delicious.
Thanks for the Anniversary Cake, it makes our stay even better."
Loved the food ambience and the servce by the staff. Would surely recommend to my friends and family. Defintly would rate 5 stars. Everyone will love it also do visit with family for a Pleasant time👌🏻👌🏻
"Went with my family on a special occasion to Baan Thai, really good service and great food. Our waiter Asif was really polite and catered to all our needs.
Try out the Nam Phrik Phao (with Chicken)
+points for the ambience."
"The Oberoi Grand has always been special due to its charm, old school feel, understated and yet classy ambience..but what always takes the cake is the magnetic personality and warm hospitality of the young extremely well-groomed Oberoi staff. No exception this time, as well!
We were at the Thee Sixty Three hoping for a nice lunch. Debdut and Suvbarna Gurung  are young, precious gems who ensured that we have an awesome lunch..their knowledge, confidence and most importantly, passion to make every guest feel special shone bright! 

Thank you, Oberoi Grand, as always for making our visit memorable! Thank you, Debdut and Gurung, once again!"
"The service as well as the food are equally brilliant. The ambience is very peaceful.
Great for occasions and celebrations. The fish and prawn are elite. 
Would 10/10 recommend this place.
The green Thai curry is amazing :)"
"Food and hospitality of the restaurant was outstanding! I am very impressed with the way Abhishek attended us, suggested food, and served us. I have visited this hotel after a long time. Nothing has changed. Hope to visit again! :)"
"Extremely content about my recent stay at The Oberoi Grand in Calcutta. I had heard about the service of Oberois and was left stunned seeing how they exceeded my expectations. They take care of small things and go beyond all to make our stay lush and comfortable. Due to my business travels I do stay at different many properties across but this business trip had instances which overwhelms me and I would love to come with family for vacations.

Starting from checkin - I was welcomed with warm smiles and upon just mentioning that I am a sucker of fresh air, Vicky took me to one of the Balcony rooms which had the most amazing view and the coverage area was a bonus. Also huge thanks to Vicky for taking care of my stay and everything just through a text.

The food was great and somehow it felt very much homelike. Absolutely loved the Thai restaurant and the breakfast spread."
"Had a great time at Oberoi Grand Ban Thai. Excellent t food and ambiemce to complement our 26th Marriage Anniversary dinner .                                                          
THANKS Ankit for your service and advice on the right food . You been a great help"
"My stay at the hotel was well taken care of. The room was cozy and comfortable and had its own old world charm. I wish I could stay longer but had to move out soon due to my business trips. Would like to mention Vicky at the Front Desk for all his help. He impeccably reduced my extra work load by helping me in my paper work. Loved the care and professionalism. 
Would love to visit soon."
We had a very good experience dining at Three Sixty Three restaurant. The food quality and ambience was great . We were helped to a great extent by Abhishek in our food selection. His recommendation of Country Chicken and Coconut Rice was delicious. Even the starters were very good. Overall we liked it very much.
"We visited three sixty three on 5th of Feb and was attended by Mr Debdut.

He was extremely professional and polite with his service.

He helped us the best delicacies from the menu and also curated dishes according our taste.

Spectacular service. Keep it up and keep delighting all you come in touch with.

Thank you Mr Debdut for one of the finest service.

Funfact: Apart for the exceptional service, Mr Debdut is also a Table tennis player enthusiast and has played India under 14 tournaments and coached several people on the same."
"Oberoi Grand is an incredibly wonderful place to pick if you are visiting Kolkata. Each and every member of the staff is very warm and their service is par excellence. Not to mention, the hotel is a heritage property and a part of Kolkata’s history and identity of being a melting pot of cultures. Each and every corner of the hotel has a unique story to tell. Do request for the hotel orientation tour when you check in to know the fascinating story of this building! You are sure to be left awestruck!"
"this was a great stay , this is far better than ITC , we had a great time here  . breakfast was great . and above all the staffs are very humble , koushikee helped me right from checkin till check out . pritam was also helpful . ill come back with family again"
Thanks to Vicky for suggesting us the pool side for our dinner. We keep coming often but had never tried the pool side and he happen to recognise us and suggested to try out the pool side. Debayan at the pool who took care of us was really great.
"Excellent food and hospitality! The preparations were made to their optimal quality! The service was one of the best we have experienced, thanks to Khitish who did a great job in that department. Would definitely like to visit again."
"Food was awesome, hospitality even better - Mr. Ankit was extremely welcoming, charming and made sure we are not only full but happy too!! I guess, it’s just not the chef and food that makes this restaurant one of the best in India, it’s also the hospitality and front ofc staff that adds to the pleasure. A must visit if you are in Kolkata!!"
"Stay was awesome,Food was as usual yummy .
Took proper care of hygiene and covid rules were followed too 
Best part was the hotel tour hy Mr Sarkar.
He told us such old time stories about the origin of the hotel 
Thanks a lot Mr Sarkar ,you took us way back in time ......🙏
One must visit the hotel of in kolkata
Stay is wonderful."
"We were welcomed by Vicky for our stay. He surprised us cake wine and sweet hampers. The gesture was very sweet. We loved every bit of our stay. The food is great and fulfilling. 
As promised we are celebrating all our anniversary here."
My stay was very comfortable. Thanks to Vicky for all the help. It was a last minute room request and I was made comfortable in a room as needed. The restaurant 363 serves the best food. Absolutely loved the thali style food. So sumptuous. Thanks to everyone. Keep up the good work
"We had a short one night stay at The Oberoi Grand Kolkata and it was seemingly perfect. Upon checkin we were upgraded to room which had balcony and that was the best thing ever that ever happened to us in hotels. Vicky was very charming and sweet and walked us to the room. The room was specially decorated for our anniversary. We were so overwhelmed. 

I happen to mention that it was our first visit to Kolkata and I love sweets. He even packed special bengali sweets. We immensely loved it.

Please do choose the hotel to make your special days more special"
"The concierge desk was extremely helpful end-to-end. Although my booking at the Oberoi Grand was made shortly before arrival at Kolkata airport, Aaron from concierge reached out to make sure the hotel car was waiting as my flight arrived after midnight. He also arranged an excellent tour of Kolkata with an excellent local resident expert of the city that made my visit more authentic. My flight got rescheduled due to covid and Aaron was extremely helpful to arrange my luggage to be delivered to me. Thank you for the strong follow-through from the concierge team. The front desk team is highly personal in their approach, they remember guests and ensured I was comfortable throughout my stay. Soumajit and Arpan checked with me to make sure I was happy at the Oberoi Grand from the point of check in and I found the front desk to be very open and willing to help which I continue to appreciate. Special mention to Ankit in the Thai restaurant who recommended a delicious dinner despite a late night order, as well as Ajay in the driveway who provided great advice for the local area . Thank you!"
"Excellent service by Rishi at 360 degree. Great soup and fantastic fare. Amazing poolside view, enjoyed the lunch thoroughly. Kids really enjoyed the ambience and they were very happy. Thanks to the entire team Oberoi Kolkata"
"It was a pleasure hopping in for coffee after the hustle and bustle of the streets in Kolkata.
I was served by Abhishek, who was well aware of his job and also a pleasant young man. 
I highly recommend- Cold coffee and chilli toast"
"Had a great time today with family. Perfect atmosphere to catch-up with friends and relatives amidst the hustle in the heart of Kolkata. Excellent food, awesome ambience. Special thanks to Rishi Raj for being so courteous. Highly recommended!"
"It was a quick ""work from hotel"" stay and everything went great. Starting from reservation to checkin everything was smooth. The room was spacious and well furnished. Thanks to Vicky for arranging everything on s very short notice. Absolutely loved the service. The restaurants are great. Even though they had some ups and down they knew their job and left no stone unturned to leave a great impact. Shall be back very soon."
I am just wowed by the hospitality received at The Oberoi Grand Kolkata. It was a very very nice and comfortable stay. The people are so so ready to help and make the stay even more comfortable. The room was the highlight. Everything is just top notch. They do take care of ALL your requests. You just need to say it. Thanks to Vicky for assisting with late night queries.
"Hardik Rathod  
Was very good who provided me with awesome service.
Since I was in in COVID so your team helped me out very well. And among other hotels I the area this hotels has been providing with such good food and best people."
"Every time I come to Grand Oberoi Kolkata I get a new experience. Marvelous hospitality. The sunbath on the spacious porticos, the customized bed and the food are the hallmarks you seldom forget about. Koushikee and purity helped . So thank you. I'll come back"
"Oberoi Grand always had special place in my heart with full of childhood memories but I never chose to stay here. Now I am thinking why I didn’t stay here before. Best thing about the place is they have kept the history intact full of class. Meticulously made sure old charm and modern facilities coexisted seamlessly. Best part were the staff. Everyone of them, such young crew, yet knew the whole history of the place and could hold lovely conversation. So many to name but here are few of them I would thank specially: Debdut 
Rishi raj
Debdutt
Debayan 
Ankit 
Priti
Koushikee
Soumyajit - duty manager
Also thanks so much for arranging my early check in!! It was a life saver.
Can’t wait to be back!!"
"Ankit and Tenzing at Baan Thai  helped us a lot with all the authentic Thai food they were really courteous and helped us a lot, excellent dinner should visit Baan Thai when you are in the city had Stir fry prawn and Phad Thai noodles 😀"
"It was an amazing experience altogether. The food, hospitality, ambience, everything was outstanding.
Chanda, Ankit and Asif who waited upon us were so polite, professional and amiable. Would visit again!"
"Please, if you are visiting Kolkata, stay at the Oberoi Grand. I've stayed several times, and somehow, each time is better than the last. The staff are exceptional and their hospitality is the perfect balance of generous and respectful. You're in the heart of the city but the hotel itself is an absolute oasis of calm."
Baan Thai was Great. Also Koushikee Ma'am and Soumyojit Sir were great with the check in and check out procedure.The food was great also in the threesixtythree must try the buffet breakfast and the camemburger.The minibar was also like a cherry on the top.
The service at the hotel oberoi was exceptional. We were particularly impressed with how the hotel staff anticipated our needs especially Mr Hardik Rathod. We loved how he was always polite and helpful.
"We had  a lovely dinner at the Oberoi Grand poolside. we had the prawn risotto and thai yellow curry . The  food, service and ambience was lovely.  Will definitely be back soon . A special shout out to  Tushar who very kindly made us taste Banana bread which we last ate a couple of decades ago! Taking some home!"
"Mr Debdut served us, and were very happy with the service.
He is very attentive and has a very plaesant personality.
He was very courteous and the service was very exceptional. We were very very happy.
Thank you"
"We took a quick impromptu detour at the Oberoi, Grand on an early morning, right before our trip. We were hungry and wanted to catch a quick bite. 

Debdut Mukherjee, our host was extremely courteous and accomodating. We just wanted a cup of tea and he went out of his way to make us a pot himself as it was quite early in the morning. The tea reminded us of home.

We weren't too hungry but he offered us some delicious omlettes and hashbrown, stating that it is a ritual for Bengalis to have at least a bit of something before leaving home.

Once we were done and called for the cheque, he casually said that it's been taken care of. We were genuinely touched by the whole gesture. 

But what makes this experience worth remembering is the heart warming approach that Debdut and Oberoi extended to us.

What a great start to the trip!

P.S. The food on the plate is half eaten - too delicious to resist!"
"Writing here my experience is totally different of what I felt staying at the Oberoi Grand Kolkata.

My late night almost early morning arrival was handled by Vicky with great sophostication. That was super quick and included no unnecessary conversation as he understood I was tired. Due to flight delays I decided to order my dinner. Thanks to Vicky again for getting my order ready on time in the room. And thanks for extra mayonnaise 😋. I loved the service, the people, the hospitality something which we miss out on international chain. So thanks to Vicky and Grand for initiating the spark in me for Oberois. Shall be visiting more often now."
"Rajib: we had nice dinner. Taste was really good for all the items chosen. They guided well too.
The guide was Ankit. His recommendation helped us to choose. Ambience was also superb.

We also had a nice surprise as a anniversary cake at the end."
"We went for our 10th anniversary dinner at the pool side at Oberoi’s. The service provided by Niranjan was fabulous. We were made to feel very special . 
The food and ambiance of the place was outstanding…
Niranjan took the effort to capture the moment for us…
He was very courteous and polite…"
"The ""Royal Taste"" of the hospitality. Highly recommended to all. The best of the best service ever I seen. 100% satisfied. In future if I get the scope then again I will be happy to stay at The Oberoi Grand, Kolkata again and again. Hats off to all the members of The Oberoi Group."
Absolutely loved our stay at the hotel. We were upgraded by Vicky on our special occasion and Ruchika was sweet enough to take us through our room. The room was so well designed and chic. Loved the food and the ambience and the stay added to our Celebration.0
"I am a regular in Baan Thai, and never go back unsatisfied. Khitish and Ishali made sure that our experience is great and also customised the food as per our requirement. Amazing ambience and service."
The food was exotic. Enjoyed it very much. The ambience was fantastic. The service was extremely good. The staff are extremely polite. Doma had served us and I found her to be extremely polite and efficient. The birthday cake was outstanding. Was referred to 363 by one of my friends. Wish to visit again.
"Had a great time here. The service was excellent and the food top notch.

The tofu is a must-try. The soups are all great, with the chefs special Thai curry being one of a kind.

The authentic ambience brings it all together in a seamless delectable blend."
"We traveled to Kolkata as a family and stayed at The Oberoi Grand for couple of days. The one thing which we highly recommend to anyone travelling during these times is that The Grand takes ALL the necessary precautions. Our checkin was completely contactless from the point of making the reservation. The rooms were kept sanitized. The hotel itself is so clean and hygienic. The people are so friendly yet aware if their surroundings. Entering the hotel felt like a positivity against  our fearless to the pandemic.

The rooms are wonderful and elegant. The food is great for food lovers. We were lucky enough to take a tour of the hotel and feel the greatness of each wall and painting we crossed. All the very best to Vicky there at the Front Desk to make our stay even more wonderful and cherishable.

Love and Regards
Sattar Family."
Fantastic Services…..Awesome food true to taste & excellent service of Mr. Khitish from 363 deg made it extra special. Try the Thai & Japanese cuisine which are so authentic & flavourful……the Anglo Indian chicken cutlet is also very good & refreshes your old kolkata memories…. Definitely a must try place for amazing experience.
The food was really good. Would definitely recommend to all of you. Relished everything right from appetizers to dessert. The drinks were also quite good. The service was very fast. Loved the ambience too
"We had a remarkable stay at The Grand Hotel, a landmark of Kolkata’s past, present and bright future. If you wish to immerse yourself in this city, The Grand is ideally located in Chowringhee. This marvelous hotel is a short walk to the Indian Museum and Asiatic Society and not far from Victoria Memorial. We also took a stroll through the Eden Gardens to the Hooghly River, a memorable experience! But while the Grand is an indisputable Landmark, I found it to be a Treasure and its people, the most precious gems. Each staff member is an Ambassador of Indian hospitality, a unique combination of excellence and care. I will not forget your wonderful “eye” smiles and greetings, your impeccable housekeeping, how you introduced me to green peas kachori and cholar dal and your professional guidance on the city, including excellent suggestions for art galleries. We also indulged in exceptional food and atmosphere at “Baan Thai” (loved the tiger prawns!). I cannot wait to visit you again! Thank you for allowing me a glimpse of the soul of this marvelous city!"
"I would highly recommend travellers to stop by at The Oberoi Grand. I was on a train to Calcutta when I happened to call the hotel super early in the morning and cut to 10 minutes I received a confirmation mail with all my needs. Vicky was so efficient and knew exactly what I need and got everything ready within a short span of time. He even upgraded the rooms and made sure our stay was perfect. To people thinking making reservation is a task, its actually a cake walk and the hotel is the cherry on top. Beautifully located i'm the heart of the city. The interiors are worth staring. This was a very short trip but has definitely left a impact."
"Loved my business trip at The Oberoi Grand. Great location, beautiful property, antique yet cozy rooms. Great workforce and efforts. Sumptuous food. Overall a good package for a stay or a vacation. Also mention to Vicky at the lobby for assisting through and through out."
"We stayed at The Oberoi Grand for a short vacation and absolute loved it. The hotel, it's location, it's people and the food is top notch. We were delighted since our checkin and it continued till the checkout. Thanks to Vicky for all the help and assistance. The breakfast spread is so far the best in the city."
"We as a family travel quite a lot of places but unfortunately had never stayed in Oberois before. Due to lockdown while we were state-locked, we planned to break out to The Oberoi Grand during New Years and now we are in absolute love for the brand.

Starting from the checkin which was smooth as never seen before. The happiness that radiates in the people standing on the other side of the count is impeccable. We were WALKED to the room and that is so new to us in today's world. That conversation, that human touch is what one should experience atleast once. The stay was beyond perfect. Housekeeping makes sure they treat you like their children and keep on checking on you to ensure that the stay is well taken care of. We were lucky to usher 2022 by the pool side and the evening was so extravagant. We tried possibly everything - 363, Baan Thai, Pool Side and even the Spa : and it somehow leaves us so speechless that every nook and crook of the facility provided felt so warm and overwhelming.

Apologies for the delayed review but would definitely mention names of people who made it extra special. 
When it came to housekeeping - Siddharth was a gem.
Our table care takers were elegant too and knew their job ( I cannot recall them but huge thanks to those guys)
When it came to check out - Vicky made it so special by continuing the checkout formalities at the Poolside as we were running late for our Destination but also wanted to enjoy the last coffee at The Grand. He was true example of ""Hospitality beyond books"". 

You guys should definitely keep up the spirit and see you soon and more often.

Regards
Soumik"
We are enjoying the pleasant memories and homely stay we had at the Oberoi Grand Kolkata. Simply outrageously superb service delivery and standards. It is really a loving hangover of sumptuous food. Would really like to visit again
Great hotel.. situated in a prime location with easy access to the airport and city center. Great staff.. hospitality is great. the ambience is really nice and the covid protocols are strictly followed!
"ITC experience is always amazing. All COVID protocols followed. Prompt service. Staffs are super friendly. Room was real pleasant. Located in one of the prime place yet it brings you close to nature with almost no sound of the outside world. Food is real good. Must mention about Mr. Bireswar Mondal from housekeeping. He fixed the room in super less time and have been extremely kind. Such a nice gentleman. Thank you soo much.

A couple of things that the management may look into:
1. Check in process can be better. I had to wait nearly 30 mins as only 1/4 counters were in operation. In the busy time you got to operate all 4 counters.
2. Orders at breakfast table at Eden Pavillion can be served on time. I ordered something from live counter which never came."

The food is absolutely amazing, the breakfast spread is healthy and tasty, perfect for a start of an exciting day. The staff is extremely cordial and are very accommodating to all the needs."
"At first instance I amazed with the atmosphere and food quality.. The staff behavior, food quality, Decorations everything is perfect. First experience at ITC Royal is amazing. At this covid situation all safety measures followed. Super experience."
"Visiting this hotel after a gap of 5 years and a new hotel has come up right next to it by the same group. I stayed at both the hotels and so this hotel seemed a bit old and also there are hardly any residents here.

 I got a room on the first block facing the road and it is clean and well maintained. The beds are comfortable and the room is well equipped with all the amenities. The breakfast buffet is not as amazing as on my last visit."
"Good, timely service and ambient staff. Helped me with problems such as restarting the TV. Immediate response to the issue. Gave good suggestions on planning trips here and also described many interesting facts about the hotel I was curious to know."
"What can I say about the hospitality of ITC Royal & Sonar, we all know how great it is.

.

"Excellent, beautiful and well sound-insulated rooms offer respite from the busy streets of Kolkata. Very comfortable beds and everything here made with high end materials and finishes.  Breakfast buffet is also very good as well as the fact one can also easily get over to ITC Royal to their fantastic restaurants.  Front Desk is world class as are the housekeeping personnel.  Truly relaxing and wonderful stay!"
"It was my child’s 9th birthday and the staff went out of their way to make her birthday special. My daughter loves the ITC group of hotels and insists on visiting it every time. Loved the ambience of the room, the lily pond with fishes and ducks. Special mention to Sailja for making it special."
"Had a pleasant stay at ITC Sonar. 
The staff was very friendly and very accomodative. safety  measures and covid protocols were followed as per the norms.
It has a scenic beauty and is mesmerizing.
Rajiv, kaushik and Shailaja were very helpful."
"Quality Hotel.
We stayed with family in two rooms in Dec 21. The property is well laid out and interiors are good. We got early check in and the staff was supportive of our early arrival around 11 am.  We ordered room service and they delivered in good time. The food quantity was good  for 2 of us. 
The property is well laid out with the baganbari theme and it works well for this luxe place. The exterior needs a good refurb though. 
The break fast spread was good, though we would have liked a better variety of fruits. The bakery items were excellent and so were the choice of yogurt’s. The south Indian dishes were not upto mark ( maybe ‘cos we South Indians are used to better tasting South Indian dishes at home). But from my experience with other ITC properties in Mumbai and Delhi, the South Indian fare definitely need to improve in  kolkata hotel, considering this was their flagship property. 
The staff as usual are pay attention till they spot someone familiar or important. Then the attention drops and one need to catch the eye of the manager  or one of the staff.  We are used to this in  other business hotels, but not expected in a luxury property.  Better training or adding staff is required. 
Also, maybe due to Covid Restrictions, the cigar lounge and dum pukht were closed  for guests.  Would have loved to be in the cigar lounge and relax with their excellent cigars. It would have been a good idea to keep these open with appropriate distancing policies. The hotel was fairly well occupied when we stayed. 
There seems to be a feeling that ITC are shifting attention to the new Royal Bengal property ( maybe I’m wrong), and that this property may not receive the attention it deserves. 
All in all a good place to relax and laze around in the heart of city"
I have been staying in ITC Sonar for last 15 days and I find it a real nice place. Ambience is good and staff shows eagerness to address the requirement. Breakfast has variety. Food is spicy and spice lovers will enjoy dinner too
"The hotel maintains the COVID protocol properly
 The staffs are well mannered. The food was served hygienically. The interns are very good. I have talked to sayonika and she was very humble and we'll mannered"
I came here for the first time and the hotel was very beautiful as I heard. Specially the staffs are very cooperative. The hospitality that they gave was upto the mark. A lady named sailija was very kind and helpful.
The stay was very comfortable and lavishing. The COVID protocol are maintained as per norms. The food was very good. The staff are well mannered and I would definitely visit the property in nearby future
"Excellent place for stay ,foods are good delightful . zakuji steam bath is must try, some staff are rude but some are good specially one staff I met ""bireswar mondal"" Best man as i ever met helpful nature , caring personality"
"the rooms are really nicely maintained and the breakfast is really nice and delicious. the part i liked the most is the the ponds along with the fishes,ducks and water lillies. i think the outer area of this hotel is really beautiful."
"An Oasis in the Chaos of Kolkata, located opposite the Science city, Kolkata. A hotel with an outstanding landscape design by its American architect.

However, the entry to the hotel is most unwelcoming starting from the entry gate till the reception. A series of grumpy, unwelcoming faces and protocols. No smile, no welcome only some checks! 

Till you struggle to reach its slightly hidden reception, you are own your own- mostly Atma Nirbhar with your luggage and braving some very old and heavy glass doors.

As you reach to the reception, same experience of "" No smile"" "" no welcome"" ...or not even an welcome drink!

The reception guy behind the reception glass wall ( Pratik?) reminded me about the movie "" Sholay"" and it's "" angrez jamaane"" ke Jailor! Even before he handed over the room key, he gave me a long list of "" Do not Dos"" in the hotel....! By now, you may start cursing yourself for booking yourself in this hotel!!

But as soon as you got the key, some one comes and takes your luggage, and then guide you politely to your room. I was given a ground floor room 3004, next to the Swimming pool. A brilliant room layout and internal design. One starts liking the room as soon as you enter!

Later, I realised that I was upgraded to an ITC One room, thanks to the non smiling guy at the reception.

I continued to stay for 5 nights ( in two blocks) and I loved every bit of my stay here. The outstanding lotus pond in the central vista is a great hangout places.

Another USP of this property, is, there very friendly and always willing to help staff members every where, except when you enter! 

Morning Breakfast is served at the Eden Pavilion. It's a good spread but very very imaginative list of items and more problematic is the clumsy  sequence of these items!

But the floor manager, Mathew and his team are terrific in responding to all your needs from a Poori to a Masala Dosa. Very prompt and caring bunch of team! We loved this place!

If you love green and quite landscape, this hotel is for you! In the Chaos of Kolkata Traffic, this place is a sort of an Oasis."
"The location, ambience and the facilities are simply amazing .
Special mention to Mr Bireswar Mondal , from the housekeeping staff, he was polite, professional and very helpful, and made sure our stay was comfortable ."
It was so pleasent to have such a good service. Felt so familier and helping that it never felt like i was staying out of my home. Room service gesture always made me feel like home and put me at ease and comfort.
The hotel was absolutely awesome great hospitality. Food was super delicious and staff are very helpful and cordial. I have order some food at 1 Am and they provide it with utmost care. I would recommend to at least stay once the morning pond view was worth cherishing for.
"ITC Sonar – Every Bit Gold ..or More

After almost 2 years had a chance to stay in one of most favorite ITC Hotel Property .  This place evokes in me a feeling of home away from home . The Hotel is most luxurious , very calm & serene settings ..almost a resort like feeling .

The TBR Team was very well led by Capt Aditya – Pooja & Himadri were very efficient & so was another boy ,who served me Soda Lime almost every evening …made that v nicely.

Had gone to say hello to my old friend Sumeswar at Grand Market at ITC Royal Bengal …he is such a wonderful guy , so very caring . I was served well by Sougata  at Grand Market

The house keeping team was v  good..Nazmus was particularly excellent , so was Sahil & others . Biswajit & Sandeep Das from Engg were very responsive .

"When I think of the best sushi in Calcutta, I always think of #PanAsian at #ITCSonar

I went on a girls’ night out with my mom and had a really great meal! The chef made a special sushi and sashimi platter with ebi and maki sushi as well as scallop, yellow tail and salmon sashimi! 

We also had the chicken suimai and prawn dumplings. They just melt in the mouth 😍

For mains, we ordered the garlic fried rice, Hakka noodles, Kung kratein prawn, chicken in chili bean sauce and Asian greens! The chicken and prawn are a must try, you won’t regret it!

For the finale, the showstopper was the tender coconut ice cream. You must must must try it! 

The service was par excellence - what you’d expect at @itcroyalbengal 
5/5 for food and ambience"

The breakfast has different variety for everyone, also on a sweet side as as An Italian, we usually prefer sweet. The service is up to the mark and it’s a must visit in Kolkata. Only small negative is the AC too high all over the hotel, so much that we has to go outside in the garden to feel a bit warmer. Thank You so much Sailaja for your support throughout the stay."

"I go regularly to ITC SONAR BANGLA, but this time I was a little disappointed with the service 

1. No Dental set 
2. Have to call twice or thrice to get something in my room. 
3. Bathroom door lock was not working. 
4. No one asked to ask about dinner trolly it was in the room till we check-out at 12noon. That is the reason I have to wait for 3 hours to get to my room. Just because it was not cleaned. I was not feeling well still they make me wait in the lobby for 3hrs. Even asking 5 times they have to time. 

Hope I don’t get the same experience next time."
Actually I came here to visit kolkata  to go to gangasagar . After that I came in itc  sonar it was wonderful  as expected upto the mark. The girl I met in itc named shailja helped me a lot. It was fabulous . Thank you so much itc sonar for this stay

The hotel has a very traditional yet contemporary aesthetics to it and The overall vibe is very soothing. 

The Dum Pukht restaurant was a delight and so was the massive breakfast spread. The staff is warm and welcoming and helped with the tiniest of request with a smile. 

Highly recommend and hope to experience other ITC properties soon."

"Cozy and big rooms, ambience is quite natural and soothing.  A great stay with my friends over the weekend. 

Easy and smooth check in process and following l Covid appropriate behaviour by all during security check in and during stay. Breakfast especially south indian dishes are must try."
"First the good part. I checked in the resort at around 11 PM and asked for a late checkout of 4 PM next day and the request was immediately accepted. The property is nice and rooms spacious. There is a beautiful pond with fishes and ducks.

Coming to the areas of improvement.
1. In Room dining is not upto mark. Dishes are very limited. I ordered lunch and twice the wrong dishes were sent to me. Not expected from a 5 star rated hotel. Taste was very average for the kind of premium pricing.
2. Breakfast buffet was not upto mark. North Indian dishes were very very limited. Most of it was South Indian , Chinese and Continental. 

In a nutshell, given a choice I would not return but would like to explore other similar properties."
My stay in ITC Sonar was a pleasant one i loved everything about the hotel from the food to the kind of service they provide you with its just wonderful.I will definitely come back again.Thank you all once again.

"I stayed here for 3nights as I had come with my family.Everything is so beautiful about this hotel ,the food is so delicious as well.The hotel just had its own beauty which I think is the best thing about ITC Thank you to Aditi and Vanda for showing us the fish feeding."
"It was a super pleasant and a personalised experience where we had the best of everything. The stay, the comfort, the food. Truly it was being one with Nature where we fed the fishes and ducks. 
Perfect way to bring in the winter and my birthday."
Had an amazing dining experience at Dumpukht and Peshawari. I had been there for both my anniversary and a family dinner. The food was heavenly and I loved the way the staff explained us the its origin and what would go best with it as it was our first time trying these delicacies. Will surely come back to try something new on your menu and talk to such fine staff. Good luck!
I came here with my family on and I celebrated my birthday over here . The Peshawari Restaurant over here in which they gave md complimentary cake was mind blowing and also the dal makhni. As I am a foodie I loved the restaurants and hotel also . Thank you

"It’s been a lovely experience with the team of Marriott here in Kolkata. Good location in the newly built district of the city, not hectic at all, a nice market nearby. Mall with a good grocery store is just in a walking distance. 
The hotel team is very attentive and friendly to guests. Breakfast is very good, variety of choice for all tastes. Could not try the in-room dining as the QR code in the room was not active, and no one picked up the phone at the restaurant late in the evening.
Rooms are in a good shape, very well served and cleaned - many thanks to the housekeeper Hirak Mondal. I liked everything, it’s worth it. "
"Amazing service provided the staff specially by Mr. Hirak from houskeeping department who was very polite and soft spoken and fulfilled all our requests on time. 
It was a great stay and I loved it
Thankyou so much Fairfield."

"Discovered the hotel on the net, read the recommendations and had booked the room online through Bonvoy app. Very smooth booking. 
Well located hotel in the hub of New Town, next door to Vishwa Bangla Gate (an iconic landmark of Kolkata. 
All the staff are cheerful and very helping in nature.
The buffet breakfast was not too good in certain aspects on the first day. I had filled up the feedback form. Immediately the issues were sorted out and the next 3 days we had an excellent breakfast. It's a great thing to see your feedback points are being acted upon.
The rooms are cosy. the view from our room was excellent. could see the hanging restaurant from our room.
Missed the shaving mirror. Would ask the management to install the magnifying mirror in all the rooms.
A great host out for the Chef and also a bigger shout out for Sunipa, who looked after us so well during the breakfast time on all days.
A special thank you to Subrata from house keeping, who spelled out magic in decorating and cleaning our room.
a great stay indeed."
"Excellent is the only word appropriate for this property. Decent rooms with all facilities, mind blowing food and beverages and above all extra courteous staff. Cleanliness, check-in and check-out, Valet parking and housekeeping was commendable. Special thanks to Ritika, Biswas and Supavam for their always smiling face and greetings and arranging special cake for my wedding anniversary. Kudos to all and will surely visit again. "
"Quite possibly, this is the best business hotel I have experienced. Starting from check -in, moving on to service in Kava, and housekeeping - what was unique was the genuine warmth exuded by all the staff. The room was perfect for my work - wifi available on all my 3 devices. This is the first hotel in India that I have been to where the HD channels on the TV were active! Breakfast quality was excellent, and Chef Bobby at Kava served a delectable mutton biryani on 14th evening. Mention must also be made of Ritika, Sharmila and Saurabh - really excellent service with the right amount of attention and chat. I have no hesitation in stating that my next visit to Kolkata will not see me lodge in any other hotel but the Fairfield by Marriott. My compliments to the management."

The location Newtown area is a great location, with nice amenities and away from the city's havoc.
The rooms here are perfectly sized and very comfortable. Keeping its name and brand at its peak, the hotel takes care of hygiene very seriously and keeping in mind the covid situation around the world staying here felt very safe to me. The floors and all the places are sanitized from time to time which is very nice. The cleaning staff especially Sandip Bhattacharya Ji, are very polite and great at their work, they have never disappointed in regards with their work.
The dining experience was great with a nice and wide variety of delicacies available. The area has polite staff including Nikita who is always there to help. The place has a nice view of the city which feels great to have with morning breakfast.
The place has a pool area which also has a calm and almost scening view"

Vertex is amazing place to visit if you are in Kolkata specially mention Saad and Chandan food and cocktails must try things about place it has amazing ambience and live music is rocking if you’re planning to party best place to make your day awesome
I had a great stay at Fairfield by Marriott Kolkata. The rooms are spic and span maintained by Ramprasad. He kept the rooms everyday arranged and as per my preferences.  The clothes are folded and room is perfectly  cleaned by him . Thanks for his hospitality.  Also the other staffs at the restaurant  is very cooperative  and friendly. The food also tastes very nice . The view is superb of the new town . Overall a great stay at the hotel maintaining all covid protocols. Thank-you everyone from making the stay memorable . Coming back soon
"Awesome | Bingo | Refreshing Lifestyle

Whenever I come to Kolkata, I used to stay in Fairfield Marriott only. As because their ambience is good with a view of ""Biswa Bangla Gate"", services and hospitality provided by their staffs, it always helps in refreshing memories and exchanging gratitude. 

This hotel is managed by a team of young and enthusiastic professionals. They are always ready to make you feel like home. The whole staff is friendly but some important names are :-

1. Chandan Chakraborty (vertex)
2. Saad (vertex)
3. Priyam Biswas (pool area)
4. Sanu Gozdar (housekeeping)
5. Roopak (Chef)

All of them serves us as their best manner with a smile on their faces. Thank you and looking forward for my next stay with Fairfield by Marriott Kolkata. "
"This was my 2nd stay here and once again the team made sure to give us a perfect stay experience. The team at Kava is exceptional at their hospitality. Specail mention to Sunipa, Shenu, Rajiv, Chef Bobby, Ankit Bhaat, Saurav for their personal attention and extended warmth.
Thanks to their friendly gesture my 7 year old daughter has made may friends whom she will always remember."
"There was so much to be thankful for about our experience at Fairfield Marriott in these past few days. Your support helped us pull off a successful meeting with fabulous time & service.

Thank you for being such a hospitable and kind host!

Special mention to the dedicated and diligent staff- Kazi, Babu Shona, Sutanuka, Niharika, Joy and definitely Pradip Da, who were available at our service 24x7, we can't thank you enough. 
A memorable experience indeed.
Looking forward to meet you all soon! :)"
"We went for Lunch buffet on Saturday.
Taste of food - good
Services - Excellent, Friendly in nature
Variety of food was very less, no much option as Buffet Lunch
Covid protocol was maintained properly."
"Hi

Checked in hotel and find everything is as per Marriot promise...

I am G4 Radisson member and do stay at marriot only  when Radisson properties are not available.

However I will stay again and again at Fairfield marriot Kolkata just because I a m delighted by hospitality and personal service by ""Mr. Arindam Chakrabarty"" executive at lounge.

He such a friendly to all guest and I am just wondering how he learnt such a hospitality skill and understand how to win guest heart.

He is Gem of all members and Kudos to him.

Wish him a long professional life with marriot.

Also would like to praise Rakesh at kava who is also assets to marriot 

Arindam and Rakesh  ---Keep it up dear 😊"
"Service andd hospitality of the Kava was very nice. Special thanks to Binita ,Rajesh ,Seenu and Sharmila  for making our stay very convenient. I was there for about 20 days and every meal was fabulous and  ambience was luxury. Hygienic staff and quality of food was excellent. A must visit place for vacation and stay."
"After the first day of office when i came back i saw my t shirts that i left lying here n there (i can’t even remember where i left them) were well folded and placed properly. And i was like did they really folded my tshirts??
Later day i found out the room cleaning guys names ram prasad and sanu used to do it.
The hospitality is way superior than i imagined. The dining which they call kava is awesome. I liked the staff there too. They were too humble. Even for our own mistakes like quoting the wrong table while placing order they used to apologise for the inconvenience caused. The tone and words they use shows there sense of being a humble professional.
I’m really glad i chose to stay here for my business visit"
I would like to stress on the behaviour of housekeeping staff Sanu who was very helpful and responsive. As a whole the hotel's amenities were great. Special mention would be the restaurant Kava and it's staff's polite behaviour.
"Checked-in at 4th of September 21, The front office staff Raja helped me with the Checkout, Chandan from Vertex L2 and Binita from Kava L1 made my F&B experience fantastic. Thank you and looking forward for my next stay with Fairfield by Marriott Kolkata. The only thing upset me was that the Hotel does not sell Cigarettes. Kindly carry your own and bless me later."
Sanu gozdar he is an excellent housekeeping worker pleasure well mannered diseplen and asset to the organization kindly take care of him and rajesh good human being pleasent very well dressed excellent manners very caring and like a family man who takes care of guest superbly he is the nation to your hotel and chain pls take care of him
It was a very comfortable stay. The kava section was great offering varieties of food and Miss Ritika was a really great assistant throughout. The service was to the point and rooms were satisfying. It's a great place to stay for any occasion.
"The hotel certainly didnt feel like a Fairfield property but felt more like a basic luxury leisure hotel. The first impressions and initial experiences around the property did blow me away. But they gradually started exposing the typical elements of a Fairfield in various areas. Like the Room design, the fittings in the room, the quality of food etc. But at the price I paid, and the location I am not complaining! I would have given this hotel a 3 star rating  for sure, if not for the wonderfully attentive service I was showered with. That alone lifted it up to 4 stars. But they really need to pay attention to how they are implementing their covid protocols. They were flouting it more than embracing it appropriately.

LOCATION: Lovely location next to the iconic BISWA BANGLA gate.

DINE + DRINK: The VERTEX bar is a great place for an alfresco sundowner or a late evening lounge session indoors.  The Breakfast was a super crowded affair and almost scared me out of the restaurant. They could have certainly done a better job of showcasing some regional food. But instead the selection was all over the place and too many cuisines were combined to please the typical crowd looking for variety.  So they compromised on quantity over quality! The room service food was also not something to write about. But it was manageable.

ROOM: We stayed in 602, which is a SUITE room,  so this review is based on that; VIEW: Sweet view of the Cityscape ; SIZE: Very spacious suite with a living room and big bedroom; AIR-CON: Perfectly functioning cooler that helped in setting the perfect room temperature; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part to put me to sleep; BATHROOM: Stand in shower; TOILETRIES: Lovely Spa quality cosmetics by INNIS brand

FACILITIES: Compact Gym with a basic range of weights and Cardio machines good for a basic workout. But the machines were by a super local brand, so dont expect too much. Swimming pool was closed during my stay, but it did look great.

SERVICE: Friendly staff that took care of all my needs with a smile and made us feel pampered and well taken care of. Special Shout out to Argo at the front office and Rahul Kotekar(F&B head) for making the welcome experience wonderful. Excellent service by CHANDAN at the vertex bar and NEHA( Restaurant in-charge) making me feel at home!

HOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free Wi-Fi, but VERY PATCHY and quite slow at times! So forget about working from here. I had a lot of issues with my virtual meetings, and had to switch to my mobile 4G connection!!!! HUGE Plasma TV screen dishing out dozens of channels spanning sports, news, music, movies and a wide variety of entertainment in multiple languages

COVID UPDATE: Huge Area for Improvement!!!! They were doing a very shoddy  job of ensuring safety , social distancing and hygiene that was required to minimise the risk of spreading covid. . The Common areas and restaurants were especially scary places to be in!"
Resturent which is kava here is very nice.. they provide very good quantity of food in room dining and the services are really good.. thanks to mr Biswas for always taking care of us. Only the reception guys needs to get trained again on customer service .. rest all is Awsm
IT was a lovely experience.  Staffs were super sweet specially ritika singh. She is very helpful and polite. Rooms were nice and food were good. Thank you all of you. All the best . See you at the top. Cheers
"All of my friends went to stay on a football match day. Check in little late however got assistant quickly.
The rooms were nice 
The staff were helpful 
The food was delicious trust me credit goes to room service even at late night we were getting all the requirements fulfilled.
Cheers to all"
"This hotel is managed by a team of young and enthusiastic professionals, who will ensure to make your stay comfortable. 

Rooms - We stayed here for a week on the 5th floor (Room no 510).  The rooms were very clean and cozy. The view of New Town from the room was splendid!

Food -  The breakfast buffet included many options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The in-room dining experience could improve in terms of food preparation, as we had faced a few glitches here and there, but the prompt service and amends made up for it. 

Service - We were quite impressed with the service and hospitality we received from all the staff, right from check-in to check out. On checking in, we requested for a specific TV channel that wasn't subscribed to, and they were kind enough to recharge it for the entire duration of our stay. Also, the overall service was very quick and prompt, which made our stay really comfortable. 

Amenities - Due to the State restrictions, few amenities (like the pool and gym) were shut. However, when a few restrictions were lifted, they promptly complied and let us use the gym at a specific time. 

Special Mentions - A few people we'd like to mention - Atreyee from the front desk - who was very quick to respond to any issues related to the room, Sunipa from the restaurant - who checked on us regularly and made our breakfast and dining experience worth remembering, Binita from the restaurant - who remembered our preference for beverages, and made sure to serve it to us every day without us even having to ask! Also, Rajeev Ranjan (Banquet Manager), was prompt to solve any queries and issues that we had. 

All in all, we really enjoyed our stay here, and I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Kolkata and would surely go back here the next time I visit myself!

Sunny"
"Visited Kava with my parents. The food was really nice and the ambience was very pleasing.

"Super Hospitality 
Super cozy clean sanitised rooms. Warm welcome and efficient Reception at all times. Super hospitality by Sunipa in the Coffee Shop was personally interacting with all and taking care of them. Serious effort on the teams part in ensuring Covid protocols are followed."

Would like to mention few names, Sunipa,  Rajeev, Bishwas and a special mention for Rahul Kotekar, you guys rock..... You are the reason for my return, keep this up!"
Good care taken by mr. Biswas f&b staff. After long flight tiring day we expect good food. It's my second visit here. Both the time my expectation were fulfilled. It feels great & special when good & cheerful staff like biswas attend us. Thankyou for making my stay worthful.

"Mr. Subhajit bag was done the excellent service for us. The way he serve our meal with happily and nice way that was superb. In the time of Pendamic they really work hard as the can. Whenever I visit in this hotel I really like the service and food facility. 
Thanks for every thing"
"I stayed at Fairfield for a duration of 4 days. The stay was simply amazing. The services by the hotel were extraordinary. Especially, we have found the Front Desk staff Suyash, Rajiv and the in room dining manager Pradip to be very helpful. Suyash arranged us packed breakfast everyday before we left to work. This kind of service offered by the Fairfield hotel was truly amazing and very warm. They have provided their services in a dedicated manner and tried their best to resolve any kind of issues we had. The in room dining services have been very useful, and thoughtful considering the pandemic. The room was clean and every day room service sanitized our room. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone who is dropping off in Kolkata. The hotel is in Newtown and is close to the US consulate and the Airport and many other malls. I would like to stay again here, if I ever visit Kolkata 💯. Fairfield simply left us with an excellent experience!"
"Being a bonvoy member a chose this hotel to stay in kolkata. Conveniently located near Biswa Bangla gate, near to airport and 30 minutes drive from the park Street.
Restaurant is nice with limited variety for breakfast and dinner. Special mention for Saurav dutta for his nice behaviour.
Overall a good stay for business travellers if you're in Newtown."
The service of the hotel is fantastic & top notch. Their Banquet manager Mr. Rajeev Ranjan was very co operative & ever helpful. We got delicious food prepared by Chef Arabinda Seth & Chef Bobby. All the staff were very courteous & polite. Check in check out process was smooth. The property & it's staff exceeded our expectations. Highly recommended for everyone to visit.
"Really awesome experience with this hotel. That's why it was my second visit. The entire staffs' services were really worthy. Ms.Prachi,Mr. kazi, Mr. Pradip & rest all staffs,they all were so professional & good. Just want to share one more thing that is I ordered 1 cake & hence they did not have the in house bakery they arranged it from WestIn on time & the cake was soooo good & tasty . Really Good , hygiene maintained."
"It was a wonderful experience though it was short stay however the experience was pretty good, thanks to Raja, Khatib and Gunjan from front office, Breakfast was really good which I liked and the service was very fast so special thanks to Ritika and Prasenjit..will be visiting again.

Regards,
Sangeeta Deb"
"I had a very good experience at Fairfield Marriott. I accidentally booked a day in advance by mistake. After reaching the venue even though a new joinee told me nothing can be done, Gunjan the manager at that time got on a call with me and tracked down a rep from makemytrip and finally helped me prepone the booking. A big thank you to Mr Gunjan ! 

When I checked in at 1am in the night, due to COVID and severe surge in Kolkata , few users were unavailable as the chef specialized more in Indian that Italian, yet Mr Tanmay managed to get made a wonderful chicken spaghetti for me and made that complimentary as I had a really long day.

For the next day's breakfast, the restaurant team (a lady) took a mental note all my orders. The same food I wanted from inside the kitchen and not the food displayed outside because of the pandemic. She didn't skip a single dish delivered all of it at a distant table which I got re-sanitized and sat down. 

Fairfield's team & staff are humble , caring, empathetic & hardworking. It was priced at 3.6k (inclusive tax and breakfast) on MMT. I just got lucky to have found that hotel ! Truly a 5star ! "
"Being a non-resident guest, the Hotel and its staff, Raja Chowdhury has won my heart. My best friend, Tauseef Shiekh had checked in and I was unable to make it for his birthday. 
The least I could do was to have a cake sent across, which I did. And a BIG thank you to Raja Chowdhury for being such an approachable and helpful person. He put a smile on the face of a Hotel's Guest but most importantly, made it possible for me to make my best friend's birthday more special even in my absence. Thank you once again 😃"
"Binita, Sharmila, and Suvendu did an excellent job serving us. They made us feel so comfortable and helped us refresh from our tiring day :)
Really thankful to them for making it better for us. Hopefully, the next time I come here, they are also here."
"The services and attitude of Ms. Sharmila, Ms. Binitha, Ms. Ritika, Ms. Alisha, Mr. Rajesh, Mr. Saswat, Ms. Tamishra,  were excellent. Their contribution in attending the guest is highly appreciated. Wishing them better future and growth."
"Extra ordinary food

Join me at Facebook. For further comments and sharing."
Short stay for us. But loved the property! Rooms are good.Looking forward to coming back again. Suyash from Guest relations was really warm and welcoming and made sure that our stay was pleasant and Fantastic!
"I am staying here for a longer time. I have given review already. Wanted give one more review as things changed from some time.I cannot say enough about the level of customer service, they are simply amazing. 
I am taking a few names that I remember who have helped me. However, its not just the one's I have named but all of them want to ensure your comfort.
A few that stand out are Anjali, Chef Bobby, Chef Biswajit, Chef Dipankar Amanpreet and  
the service from the associates and executives ( Mr Saumik , Mr Argha, Mr Tanayjit, Ms Sumana, Ms Ritika, Ms Vinita ) is good as always. They are very patient and pamper me so much.

Most importantly the hotel was following all the safety protocols regarding COVID-19. It was just a perfect stay in such difficult times . The service of the hotel is very precise, they know exactly what the customer wants. Thanks to the hotel team, Will definitely visit again."
"Visited Vertex with my friends! View of the restaurant, food, service, staff no words to compliment the same. Outstanding Pizza by Chef Panja and Suman. Will definitely visit again! Team Vertex keep it up."
"I stayed here twice in March on 25th and 27th. Appreciable job done from check-in to check-out, clean and tidy rooms, good food and laundry on time.

Special thanks to very friendly Kawa staff Prasanjit and Ritika as they create Gastronomic extravaganza and the dining experience a memorable one.

Both days I got late from work and entered restaurant at buffet closing time. Your staff are always there to go out of the way and help for whatever you want.
Best wishes to all your staff, specially the two mentioned above."
"The general upkeep is very good .The reception by employees was marvellous two of them one Mr, Rajiv Ranjan of Kava restaurant & a trainee named Sshubhra are really praiseworthy.
                  Howsoever reaching my floor by lift was really a cumboresome exercise as the card needs to be swiped & then the lift would accept the floor request .How so ever if your partner stays in room then you won't have the magnetic card & this created hell of the problem to either of you.This must be viewed seriously & nos. of cards provided must match the number of occupants in each room."
"Food was excellent stay was comfortable. Thanks to mr Rahul kotekar,  chef Ankit, chef arabindo, ms Ritika, Sunipa , rajesh, Sourav, Binita and mr Rajeev and neha ,chef bobby. And housekeeping trainees and staff were also excellent. Comfortable stay🎉🎉🎉"
"My room No. 429  was clean and hygienic. Stay was very nice and satisfying. Mr. Sanu from housekeeping  GSA took good care. 
Mr. Neeeraj panchal housekeeping Executive also took good care. Recommend this hotel to everyone."
"The property has everything you need during your stay - new, fresh rooms, - great location if you are visiting New Town, one great restaurant and one roof top bar 

Hospitality:
- Every one wears masks (covering nose and mouth)
- greets with smile and respect
- recognizes your priorities and provides quick and efficient service
- Housekeeping was great, fresh clean rooms and at times decorated with towel origami
- Front desk took care of our check-in, upgrade and efficient checkout
- Restaurant staff went above and beyond preparing food to our taste and personally checking on us

We recognize the effort from Rahul, Sunipa, Neha, Bobby and others

Our experience:
My wife and I stayed at this property for two full weeks (14 days). We were first upgraded to an executive room on the 5th level with a great view. Then after 4 days we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely

Disclaimer - we are on top tier Marriott status level, hence we give a lot of business to Marriott chain of properties and as a result get top privileges such as ""room upgrades"""
"If you are looking for a fine hotel with excellent service and professionalism, then fairfield  by marriot is the place. The hotel is beautiful and the people are extremely helpful and friendly. Kava is the restaurant and is a must try for dining. Special thanks to Jr. Sous Chef Mr. ANKIT BHATT, for being extremely kind and accommodating. The food prepared by him for my engagement was remarkable, gaining extreme appreciation by all our guests. If you are ever eating in kava do make it a point to tell your personal requirements for food to the chef and he will never let you down. Special thank you to Gurmehar, Saad Ahmad and Jessica Sahay who were willing to understand all our requirements for the engagement in a very accomodating manner and catering to all our needs.
People here dont forget you even if you have been their guest just for a day and they meet, greet and deliver a 5 star experience for you everytime you meet them.

I am extremely pleased by the people and the hotel and definitely recommend the place for my fellow travellers."
Chandan has been such a good friend and a such  a such server. Please look for him.loved the ambience. I loved the food and such a great ambiance and again the place was amazing . I loved the noodles and the paneer roast
"Everything was good in the property.
Areas of improvement:
-Something need to be done to Stop flies entering into room.
-Breakfast fast spread was less.

Thanks Mr Rahul(F&B ) head to provide courteous and delightful service in regard to listening small concerns and providing immediate resolution for the same.
Will surely recommend this to everyone if anybody wants to stay near Airport or Salt Lake.
"
"Good comfortable rooms, warm and hospitable reception, courteous staff, all was going decently well. Then the experience at the Cafe during breakfast time - majority of guests not wearing masks, everyone was handling the buffet, what was shocking was food which was fallen on the counter was picked up by the Chef and put back into the buffet, uniforms of their training staff was like it was never washed, though when brought all this to the notice of the manager corrective action was taken immediately. But why wait for an issue to be told, why there wasn’t any attention to detail by the team members. Why can’t the staff try or put some effort to ensure guests wear masks when at buffet. Ignorance is never bliss in such time that we are all facing. All was going well till this last episode which shattered the experience in bits."
"The food choices are very limited. Surprised to see very few local dishes. Bengali sweets got over at 9.30 pm. 
Very bad service. Chef Arabinda was arguing instead of finding solutions for the poor service and breakfast"
"I keep on visiting kolkata specially in this hotel, staff i really appreciate , friendly nature, approachable, special thanks to Seenu this tym , she made my evening by this lovely gesture that too when i was craving for  🤗🤗 thanks dear"
We had amazing time at The Vertex. This has a verandah with beautiful seating arrangements. Live Music was both soothing and lively. Offers great food with  pan Indian and continental choices. Chef Vishwajit and his team made it a memorable evening for us
"I was given a room after waiting x 6 hours at the Fairfield by Marriott Kolkatta
My keys don’t work, the duty manager Arghya Sarkar was absolutely rude and inhospitable 
Told me it’s my fault that the keys don’t work
Other guests came down with me to report the same issue and then he had nothing to say and disappeared in his back office 
Trainee at the front desk least apologized and  acknowledged that they are facing a problem with the keys getting deactivated !

Not a good experience at all
At the breakfast table they forgot to serve me coffee that I had requested 
Absolutely pathetic service

"I actually don't know where to start from. Whether I should start from amazing ambience, welcoming guestue of all the people of vertex or with world class service of Mr. Chandan Chakraborty and our Chef Biswajit. 

Woaah! What a memorable stay it way from soft and smooth hospitality to Mint on the Rock drinks, with random no of Taquila shorts consumed with them vibe suitable sound from the DJ in the glass House Mr. Ajay all these were not enough to pamper us enough so, Mr. Pradip and Mr. Gourav also came in. Such good coordination the team has with particular details being taken care in out every serve, we felt like a family to themselves. 

It was glad to stay, with such gentle and warm hearted atmosphere. Due to my privacy and security concerns I won't be able to share my image but I would share it of our team, which we captured to make this trip memorable so that we can recall the moments after years. 

I would suggest you to definately visit this place if you are in Kolkata and if possible you should arrange the stay in weekends as they have blissful evenings with live music and thundering DJ at the end, which can make your vibes move towards positive energy , which helps your in creating a better environment for yourself, resulting it into becoming a better world. 

People you should know before you visit Vertex / Fairfield Marriot, Newtown, Kolkata. 

1. Mr. Chandan in Vertex
2. Mr. Pradit in Vertex
3. DJ Ajay in Vertex
4. Mr. Gourav near pool area
5. Chef Biswajeet

Apart from this, their whole team is just amazing and filled with surprises to make your trip memorable.

I being a Gujarati, we can't forget to give tip to the people who wins our heart. But this team, OMG they don't accept the tips! Even after forcing them up for a long time!
They just care for your lovely and comfortable stay. 

If I plan my trip to Kolkata, the first thing I do is, I ask my secretary to reach out to Vertex in Fairfield Marriot, Newtown and ask them to connect me to Mr. Chandan for reservation of my table for Friday and Saturday, if there are no other private bookings. Then my next step is to book flight tickets for Kolkata. "
"The hotel is a new property and is perfect for a business trip. The hotel entrance is facing the side road and  so one can't easily see it from the main road. The check-in was smooth and professional. The rooms are very good with all amenities. The rooms are slightly on the smaller side but wouldn't matter for 1 or 2 persons occupancy. They had an excellent HD television with almost all channels available. Breakfast has a good spread with even a maggi counter for the kids. They also have a vending machine with some snacks and drinks at the lobby. Finally, full marks for the staff attitude, politeness and eagerness to assist with your requests. The tariff is also very reasonable considering the Marriott brand."
"Recently we hosted my friend's birthday party at Vertex & Fairfield team ensured it was a night to remember. Amazing hospitality, excellent service, good food and great music. Everything was as agreed & absolutely perfect. A special mention to Mr. Rajiv & Mr. Chandan. Their attitude towards guests & keeping their demands deserves a big thumbs up !!! To sum it up all i can say is despite our best drunken efforts we could not get a ""No""from them. Keep it up guys."
"Excellent dining , awesome taste n hospitality by chef Biswajit & serving aid gaurav.
Such a brilliant experience that we had ..made my sisters bday truly exhilarating. 
Must try cheese cake, chilly chicken, malai kofta, butter chicken n aloo gulistani. 
Highly recommended. "
"Recently visited Vertex with friends to spend the evening.. 
Good food , very good ambiance
Special thanks to Chandan Saad who attended us and chef Biswajit who suggested us some really good dishes.
Looking forward to visit again soon.."
Had a pleasant stay staff is very curitious and helpful. Hotel is clean and sanitized fully felt safe and cared. The amenities are of European standards. Just that some items are missing like slippers and in double room one towel had to aske for it.
I had gone there for a staycation with my wife on our Anniversary. They upgraded us to executive room which was very kind of them. The pillows in the rooms were badly stained and we had to call room service to change them. We thought of checking the bed sheets as well and to our horror the entire sheets were stained and they were just tucked inside.. never expected such a service from Marriot.. The breakfast spread was delicious but the dinner spread was average. Had to ask for non- veg starters and there was 1 lady who was their during the dinner time who does not deserve to be in hospitality. Another customer wcomplained about her at the reception desk as well. Not expected this from Marriot hotels..
Wonderful experience and delightful service by staff of Cava restaurant. Ritika and her colleagues looked after us very well all through our leisurely lunch on a Saturday. Thanks so much. Will be back soon.
"Great hospitality, good food and very good location. The rooms which face the Biswa Bangla circle are the best to stay. One point which was not good was without checking the details we were asked in restaurant to sign the bills for breakfast even though we had Free breakfast included in the package."
Been there for dinner. The array of dishes in buffet was quite good. The decor and ambience is great couple with it are the courtesy of the staffs. Special thanks to Gourab and Ritika for taking care.
I had a great experience for these 2 days and it was perfectly planned according to me and really very thank you for such a amazing hospitality 😄 It was my 1st stay with you people 😚 and I need Macarons as complimentary on my next stay😌😊
"This place is my second home not because I am a regular guest but mostly because of their beautiful hospitality. This time me and my would be booked the Valentine's Day staycation. I requested the team to decorate the room to surprise my Fiance. Must say the room was beautifully decorated. Their poolside V Day special event was fantastic. The love music band, the hookah and the food was superb. I would specially like to mention few names who made our stay special chefs-Shriya chhetri, Mohit sharma, Indraneel & my dear Chef Gaurav Verma."
"I stayed Westin Kolkata multiple times. Loved the view from the room, hotel amenities and food! But the best part is the staffs. They are such an amazing hosts! I felt personal touch and great welcoming vibe throughout my stay."
"The breakfast at Westin has always been a most delightful experience. The food quality is amazing,the huge spread is awesome,amicable and helpful staff and a fantabulous ambience adds on to the experience."
"We were served really well especially by Priti and Ayantika.Had a great time. We keep coming here and will have breakfast here again. 
Westin treats us like family and ensures that we have a good experience."
"Loved the experience at Westin, the visit was a delight.  I recommend everyone  who is into the  food scene to visit the  hotel. The food is great and so is the service. Chef Indranil and team made sure that we  received the  best they could offer. Chef Sukdeb provided us with various Tandoori 
delights, while Sanjay was kind enough  to bring us hot desserts at request.  Somnath and Avantika, from the service  were also very kind to keep  us satisfied during the visit. 
I  highly recommend the place."
"I visited  with my family and friends,the Westin Kolkata is a really nice place a big thanks to chef sukdeb & indronil 
For cooking wonderful kebabs platter it was truly awesome. I would call out especially somnath, gurkaran, sanjoy or bimal for the making the stay more special thank you 
Team westin"
I went to Nori yesterday with my friend and it was a great experience. The food was soo good and the service was really the best that I have seen any where vikash was the server who was there to help us I just asked him without seeing the menu what is good whatever he recommended was really great I liked everything that he told me to try and I had a lot of questions regarding the food and he was really polite to answer every question. Even the manager Kuntal came to my table and asked that did we like or dislike anything this was the first time when a manager was so concerned about the guest did like everything about this restaurant one of the top restaurant to visit I am gonna recommend each and every friend of mine to go there once.
"Nori is a crown 👑 for Westin Kolkata which is situated at the 31st floor, and the staffs are so courteous and helpful specail thanx to shubham and of course the manager of Noori (kuntal) is kind and humble. Chef rajaram suggested us out of menu food which has touched our heart. See you soon Noori."
"Amazzzzing lunch experience. Not only it's a treat to eyes, I bet your soul will be satisfied with the quality and variety of food spread.
Special mention to Indranil, somnath and Abhi who took care of every detail of our experience. 

A must visit for all who want to have godly experience. 3 cheers for Seasonal Tastes!!"
Its our first visit in this hote and it seems best hospitality ever staff was super polite and excited to asist you. Start From the check to check out manager Randeep and his team helps alot to make our stay memorable.housekeeping people are very perticular for room cleaning and replacing the things every day. Buffet spread was so nice and staff is well trained for taking care all the hygiene and guest. Love to visit again.
"A big Thank You to Chef Krishna for cooking wonderful Risotto for us! It was truly awesome! Even though the food took long to arrive, it was worth the wait, that means a lot of work has gone inside preparation of the meal. Also the Mushroom Soup was delectable!"
I had a great time when I visited the hotel as the staffs are amazing and hardworking. Especially mentioned Randeep who came one step ahead to make the services awesome. Great people and amazing experience. Unforgettable.
My stay was wonderful and amazing in regards to the room stay and it was made so by the wonderful team at The Westin. Thank you  and special mention to duty manager Randeep Singh who was very helpful and hospitable throughout my stay.
"Somnath was very good. Thank you for a great service and experience. We had gone for Saturday brunch. Food was good. Main course and desserts were very nice. However starters need to be better. Some non-veg items were a little off. 

Now we are heading to 31/32 for a drink."
"Found to be below the usual Westin standards. Plus++ Spacious rooms and good sleeping comfort.. location is also good.. average plus on hygiene
Negative - wood work worn out and had quite a lot of stains which takes away the beauty of the room and even in dressing and washroom you could see such visible stains. 
Food and Buffet spread : good but not great"
"My husband and I stayed there on the occasion of our 5th Wedding Anniversary and the staff members made beautiful arrangements for us to help make it special. They started by upgrading us to a high-end room than the one we’d booked; the room was decorated brilliantly and they arranged multiple cakes for us. In the evening, they gave us great accompaniments with our drinks and the food we had was also nice. 
Special thanks to Ms. Indrani Gupta for making all these arrangements and checking in on us for anything we needed.
And also, thanks to Mr. Raqibul, for taking care of our in-room dining experience."
"What a amazing dinner that was with my beloved wife shubham was coordinating with our whole set up and food wine orders he not just did it well rather I would say executed in far better than our expectations, food were amazing pairing with French wine as well specail thanks to kuntal for managing Nori very well. See you soon with my family and friends"
"I visited the Seasonal Taste, Westin, on 19th February,2022, with my family and friends (6 persons) for lunch. We had a great time there. The food spread was just awesome and very impressive and the hospitality was marvellous. I would like to specially mention some names like:

Excellent service and food. Live music also excellent. Mutton rezala was too good. Like the other food as well like doi mach. Good collection of starters. Excellent service by Preeti and Suman. Hope to visit again soon.
"We just stayed at the Westin Kolkata... we had booked a room with buffet breakfast, but also did a la carte lunch and dinner. We had such an awesome experience.  The property was clean (exactly as you see in their photos), it had a modern design, awesome food and their service above and beyond. We had a true 5 star experience.

Their staff is amazing and gave us such personalized service. Special mention: Somnath, our host for lunch & dinner, went above and beyond to ensure we have nothing less than a 5-star experience. Chefs Mohit, Shriya & Pranab pleasantly surprised us with their delectable Eggs Benedict Kosha Mangsho (spicy mutton)...  their signature dish. Sephali checked us in and took care of all our wishes, like room type selections, check-out times and even later with organizing our luggage (as the concierge attendant was busy managing the two wedding groups on-site that day!) all with a smile. Finally, Evana our host for the buffet breakfast, made us feel so welcomed and gave us an amazing experience. We were truly pampered.  

Previously, I’ve stayed in several other 5-star properties in other parts of India, other countries in Asia and other parts of the world, both Sheraton/Marriott properties as well as other hotel groups. I have to say, this experience was one of my best! I will highly recommend you give this hotel a try if you are in Kolkata… be it for the stay or just their restaurants."
"I went to celebrate my parents anniversary at the Westin Kolkata Rajarhat. I have visited Westin previously as well, but it was the first time for my family. My parents were extremely happy with their service, the city-view room, the delicious food and everything. The smiles on their face made it obvious that how much they were loving the place. I would like to specially mention Ms. Indrani Gupta, guest relationship manager who looked into everything and made sure that we have a mind-blowing experience there. Thanks to her for being there every time we had any questions. I would also like to extend my thanks to the talented and experienced chefs of Seasonal Tastes (the restaurant located on the 10th floor of Westin), who made sure to serve us exquisite and innovative lip smacking dishes. The breath-taking view of the entire city from our room on the 24th floor kept us mesmerized. Loved ever bit of the stay. Lastly I would like to say that visiting Westin is not like staying at any hotel, it's about a lifetime experience to cherish. Thank you all for making the weekend for me and my family so wonderful."
"Somnath and Manoj have been very courteous and supportive during the entire meal. 

The food at Weston Kolkata is worth the money!  
I suggest people to give it a try at Westin 

Kuddos to Weston team 👍👍👍👍👍👍"
"Nice place to stay, strategically located near to the Airport. The food here is amazing with a wide array of choices and Will not miss out mentioning Ayantika for her service with all warmth and a smile."
"My first visit to Kolkata and it was a memorable stay especially because of the warm receiption and hospitality showm by Westin staff during my stay. I have stayed at many other Mariott propoerties but this was something worth the mentions. Overall, I had a great experience; staff was incredibly helpful, and the amenities were great. The room was wonderful, clean, and perfect to stay close to Airport.

Special Thanks to Indrani Gupta who went above and beyond to make this stay plesant and fantastic one."
"I visited nori on 14th of February, i couldn't how beautifully the restruant was set up.
The courtesy given by the staff was amazing.i remember sweta and vikash who served us very well.  Starter was amazing, desert was finger licking good i must say. 
I will definitely visit nori again with my friends and family."
"Wonderful  experience, Westinn  never fails to deliver, awsome food well behaved staff and top notch service couldn’t have asked for more they helped me plan a surprise for my better half as it was her birthday and it couldn’t have been better"
I went to Nori with a friend and the ambience and the food was very good even the service was good I am quite new to the Japanese menu the was Vikas explained them to me was very great thankyou vikas I'll surely visit again. Thankyou for your service and keep this good work up
What an amazing decorative restaurant theme valentine's simply awesome great job behind the success. my thanx gose to mr. Kunal who is pro on his field his sincerity over upseeling techniques I must appreciate. Chef sanath sushi hand 9n magical part. Sweta and Vikash served us so well. Decor and theme were superb food and hospitality on top notch . Great place to visit.
Yesterday we had booked for lunch and it was quite an experience with huge spread and every preperations were hitting our taste buds. We spent over 3 hrs to complete our lunch with live music entertaining all the time. Special mention about server Somnath and special attention by Chef Indranil by offering us fresh dishes of pasta prepared in white sauce with lots of veg of our choice and mutton biriyani added with some special herbs. In sum it was complete knock out experience!!! A big thanks to the Westin team.
"We called and reserved a room with our Bonvoy membership details and were told to arrive at 2 o clock for the check-in.
We have stayed at a number of Mariott hotels, including this one, but never before has the check in process been so horrendous. We have been waiting for an hour straight and have just got the room at 3.18 pm, over 78 minutes for a check in is unacceptable. We missed our spa appointments plus the restaurants we were planning to lunch at are now closed.  We were robbed of our time, which cannot be compensated. 
Westin was great last year when we stayed here but after this experience would NOT recommend. JW marriott would be a better choice for a smoother staycation.
P. S., Shephali checked us in and promised us a eco park view after such a long wait, we got construction and empty fields as the view. Just called the reception to hear this is the only available room. Sharing a picture as proof. "
"My 1st  visit to Kolkata, made very memorable by the staff of Westin, New Town. While work was a priority, after spending a tirng day, looked forward to some rest and peaceful moments at the hotel.  The staff attitude was extremely helpful and each went out of their way to make me comfortable. I have traveled extensively but the reception and hospitality at Westin hotel was by far the best.  Special mention of Indrani Gupta who went beyond her duty to make the stay comfortable.... with her in the hotel,  I am sure no guest will feel unwelcome...."
I have never had such a delicious sushi boat.It was amazing.we hv tried the Japanese whisky toki as well.We would like to thanks to sweta as well for her suggestion.overall we got the excellent food and service.
"Came with my friends to try some Asian food.We ordered mala chx,ebi tempura and lamb chop.we enjoyed each bite of food.Thank u chef to make our day special and I would like to thanks to kuntal also to provide us a best hospitality.will visit soon."
"Best breakfast buffet of Kolkata. The buffet spread was awesome. Priti visited our table with all items from live counter and was very polite. Overall a great experience....Breakfast buffet starts at early morning and finishes at 11am. The spread has all food items like luchi, cholar dal, sausage, bacon, ham, salami, fruit juice, tea, dosa, idli, medu vada, omlette, pancakes and many more."
"We had stayed from 8th - 10th Feb 2022 at The Westin, Kolkata. I must say that the staff at the hotel ensured we had a very comfortable, seamless and delightful experience, right from the check-in to check-out. I would call out especially, Swagata, Avi, Suman and Chefs Pranab, Mohit and Bhaskar for making the stay more special. Thank you, The Westin, Kolkata."
"Had a wonderful brunch at Westin Rajarhat. One of the best spreads I had in Kolkata. The prawns at the live counter was lip smacking. Had a wide variety of deserts, you have to come back again definitely coz you will miss out on some of the items 😁. A special thanks to Somnath and Priti for taking care of our table and us ☺️"
"Got an amazing exprience in nori starting with view, food and service all are amazing. Specially we enjoyed the sake, vikas thank u for ur suggestion. We would like to thanks to kuntal and chef sanjit as well to give us the best exprience."

We had stayed in the hotel from 10-11 Feb. We are very much happy with the service provided and the ever helping attitude of the  staff including the chefs at restaurant. we will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends. Thank you for all your cooperation .💐
This property is in an excellent location and is a true luxury hotel. The beds were good so were the other services. Indrani Gupta was a fantastic Guest Relations Exec who took care of everything including a surprise Anniversary Cake. I will definitely return to this hotel.
"I had been to most of the hotels in Kolkata but none is as good as Westin, Spacious Room, good food, super friendly staff, specially Indrani Gupta, she even recognize guest who’s visiting after months, it’s superb"
"Am sharing this view after having stayed well over 500 nights at Westin Kolkata...

Irrespective of perhaps being a valued guest at the hotel, their staff has always treated me extremely well.....right from day-1 when I stayed there the first time in 2019.

Especially those at Seasonal Teste - their primary restaurant.  Special thanks to Somnath, Priti, Biki, Afsana, Swagata, Aman, Amit Das, Pintu, Suman - all of them are most attentive and strive relentlessly to extend the wamrest experience to each guest.

Nice oversight from Arup, Abhishek, Hyder, Shankar, Avhi, Tathaghata, Evana & Saba to ensure every guest is attended to.

Kudos to the chefs - Sushant, Indranil, Vimal, Sanjay, Himanshu, and Vivek, their Chief Chef - for dishing our a super spread each day.  They try their very best to make sure I don't miss my homemade meals!  Definitely recommend the Sunday bruch - a must-try.

And then, sincere appreciation of Indrayani's commitment to customer relationship.  She has always ensured total support....24x7.

Have stayed at almost all major hotels in Kolkata, and I know that the Taj, ITC, Royal Bengal & JWM currently enjoy top rankings.  But give Westin Rajarhat a chance....they have the potential to compete with the best.  Westin's differentiator is that they have succeeded in creating a 'bond' with me that none of the top-tier hotels have even tried to create.

Assuming the J W Marriott management is listening - you have a super team at the Seasonal Taste.  Keep it up!"
Really enjoyed our stay at Westin. The staffs were very friendly and helpful. Special mention to Ankit and Himanshu as they were serving us everything we wanted. Will visit soon again with family and recommend others as well.
"Beautiful and modern facilities along with amazing, warm, welcoming staff make the westin, kolkata a wonderful experience each time. Special mention to Mrs Indrani Gupta for making our stay extra comfortable and wonderful. A hidden gem in kolkata."
"The staff and the management was excellent.
There was a vast implement of food and drinks.
Loved the dessert and tart.
Must visit once with your family and friends.
Staff : Mr. Shumon and Miss Priti.."
"The ambience is very good, the food and drinks selection was vast and excellent, with great staff and an amazing setup was joce.
Servers nice all staff helpful mr om and shubham.
Enjoyed wedding great work"
"My stay at westin kolkata was excellent ! The hotel is beautifully done with excellent hospitality. The rooms were very clean which was the best part, the food spread was excellent! The staff took extra care to make the stay comfortable- be it the housekeeping , at the reception or the chef and staff at the restaurant. The location is good and our room had a beautiful view ! I would highly recommend this property if u wish to stay somewhere close to the airport and Newtown/salt lake area."
Went to Westin for a stay…..had dinner at seasonal tastes ….must say the spread was lavish and specially Mr Somenath was very helpful and friendly……Even Ms Priya was very polite and helpful at the reception…Special mention Mr Sanjay Mehta who brought me a special cheesecake on my request…..Thanq everyone for making our stay so warm and loving. Thankyou.
"One of the best and perfect experience. I've been visiting The Westin Rajarhat Kolkata since 2017 and its always a good experience. The rooms are spacious with a jaw dropping view and all such facilities you can think of. The buffet was extraordinarily good with the chef's fusion special Egg Benedict. The courteous, professional and efficient behavior of everyone at the property gives your stay the best feel. I would also like to thank Indrani Gupta ( Guest Relation Executive ), at The Westin Kolkata, for making all the arrangements and making our stay worth the while. Thanks Indrani and The Westin for all the efforts in making our stay worth remembering each and every time we visit. 
Regards,
S. Mookerjee"

"Very good stay , loved the hospitality and warmth received at front desk .

Rooms are good , entire place gives u the smell of freshness and positivity . All the staffs working here are ready to help .

Talking about the breakfast , they have limited spread but with excellent quality . 

That spread is overcome by the behaviour of very nice staff like Saurav ( Restaurant Manager). He is a wonderful guy to meet if u are staying In this hotel .

They serve very nice Uttapam prepared freshly from kitchen which is more testeir than  dosa .

"
I had booked Holiday Inn express for 2 days for my business trip to Kolkata. The stay was super awesome and as my business got extended I extended my Stay with the hotel. The manager shireen made it very easy for me to extend my stay. Just on a what's app text the stay was extended and at a very competitive price. The rooms were offered before standard checkin time and it was sparkling clean. Staff is very polite and breakfast is mesmerizing. I would rate 10 on 10 for my stay and experience and Holiday Inn express. I would like to thank Miss Shireen the hotel manager for making my stay wonderful and I will always book Holiday inn for my next trip to the city.
"Excellent stay.. well maintained property.. very near to airport.. average buffet.. good food.. Cozy rooms..Great ambience..
Thanks to Ms.Shireen who was very proactive in handling my Check in & Check out process..
Kudos to the whole team of Holiday Inn express.. 
Keep up the good work."
"We had visited hotel very frequently. Very nice and good place to saty, Airport is walking distance is added benefit.
Room service and houseking is taking good care of us.
The food quality is also very good and economic.
Shireen had taken good care of us and help us to check in on time"
"I liked location very near to Airport. Very Good staff, very polite and always ready to serve. 
Housekeeping department is excellent, specially Payal and Priya both are very professional.
Improvement required in Room service department."
"Stayed at Holiday INN Express, I must say they really know what true guest service is. I reached the hotel early morning at 10 AM & got the room at 12.10 PM However I don't blame them for this because the standard check-in time is at 2 but I was early. However they still gave me the room & I must say the best one, which had a good view with large windows. Talking about the rooms it's not too big in size but good for 2 people. Rooms are clean with clean toilets too.  The staff is polite & very helpful. I want to mention specially about Payal from the housekeeping team. She remembered what I had asked for while I was leaving my room for the meeting in the morning & after I came back everything was placed as I required. Cheers to Holiday INN Staff. 

The food is great & with a lot of varieties both in Breakfast & Dinner. Thank you Holiday INN Express will definitely stay next time when I am in this city again."
"Why is my earlier review not showing?
The response from management is very routine. 
Reviews appear to be managed.
Negative reviews must be shown more prominently. My refund for cancellation of airport drop also not received."
"Had a great stay ! 
The ambience, breakfast, the room, the staff and service. 

Everything was great.

The location is near the airport, which is a plus point. 
Great for staying for business trips. 

Thank you."
"I along with my stayed in this hotel today just for a day as I was transiting thru Kolkata from Mumbai due to rescheduling og my flight.
Though check in time was at 2pm , the executive at the counter Ms Madhumita was just cordial and prompt in her duties. She made us very comfortable and did all the early arrival check in swiftly. She also arranged for our breakfast though it wasn't expected to us. It was such a nice gesture from Ms Madhumita. Hospitality was truly delivered with warm welcome and a smile. That is what needed nowadays.
Rest, the  hotel is good. The last time I stayed in Holiday Inn was at Beijing in 2010.
Thanks n regards"
"Overall good and pleasant stay. The rooms were neat and tidy. Room service was done everyday and all queries were solved immediately.
Express Café is very expensive for what it offeres. Coffee is horrible and any type of coffee is made purely with milk powder. Avoid coffee at all times at this hotel."

And for as long as it continues to exude the genuine warmth, we will keep returning back here again and again..Under MS.sumana, the hotel feels much more guest friendly, and has regained the x-factor which had initially drawn us to it...

First and foremost, we were greeted into our ""second home"" with one extremely pretty, vibrant and ever smiling young lady Miss sumana . She so lovingly and with utter friendliness, do full justice to the job she have been assigned with... The entire security deserve a BIG PRAISE for their tireless efforts and again, for making us feel so at home with their warmth filled gestures...

  Our deepest gratitude to her positive vibes and friendly NEs... Also she suggest to visit mayapur also, good knowledge about belur math dakshineswar,which helps a lot. Old calcutta famous  college street coffe house which is the old one, A HUGE THANKS to her for her efficiency ,politeness...
her prompt actions and her attentive attitude towards guests. She's conscientious and skillful. 

The one and only department in which the hotel still lacks in is its F&B... Still not up to mark, at least to our taste buds... Lacks the required punch that would do justice to the hotels high ratings overall...

Last, but definitely not the least, A BIG THUMBS UP to all the other departments... And as always, BIG BIG BIG HEARTFELT AND UTMOST LOVING THANKS to Sumana for taking such excellent care of us during every single visit of ours...HIEX, Kolkata will forever and ever continue to remain our ""Second Home"" in Kolkata purely because of this preety lady and the privileges we get there under her guidance..."

"Polo Floatel Kolkata is the first ever hotel in India that floats over The Mighty Ganges, I would rather call it a massive ship with Cabins not rooms folks, inside the look and feel is simply marvellous. This was my first time visit to the capital of the state West Bengal - Kolkata and I checked into this beautiful place, the moment I entered the main gate in saw two gentlemen greeting me in the attire of security personnel’s and they were closing the gate and within seconds the train passed by and I could control to take the video and cannot believe it was passing just few minutes away from the main gate wow, post entering the premises you will feel like you are on a ship which is ready to cruise, the checkin was smooth and was assisted by ms. Komolika, mr. Samiran Mondal and ms. sudipta, post which I was again greeted by Mr. Gopal the security personnel inside the ship ☺️. The ship has 3 floors plus top amazing banquet hall along with beautiful place to sit and feel the breeze of Mighty Ganges. The scenic view of Howrah bridge and Vidyasagar Setu bridge is breathtaking. On the top I met few hotel personnel’s they were extremely friendly and polite, they helped me gather more knowledge of the place and it’s surroundings. I was thrilled by their passion and hospitality, and that assured me about the bright and future vision of the owner, a clear vision always cultivate sense of responsibility and mission for their employees and you guys are doing the wonderful job. This ship/hotel is situated at VIP area and you will see a lot of massive govt. head offices near by. The charm is more enhanced by the marvellous Eden garden cricket stadiums which is accompanied by small beautiful stadiums for upcoming cricket & soccer players. If you want to have fuchka aka Paani puri then don’t forget to visit princep street which is hardly 1 km from the hotel. And please do have English breakfast in flurys it’s amazing plus finger licking experience you will have. Rest there are many places around, like Park Street etc. you can roam around and have some tasty street food. Rest the place has good vibe and also there is boat ride and the costing is around 3-5k range you can explore this option to feel the tides of Ganga. I will attach few pictures for your reference, overall I stayed for 2 days and yes it a memorable experience, thank you hotel staff and Polo Floatel management team, definitely I will visit again !

Loads of love & support
- Paz"
"We went there in the evening to celebrate our mom's bday.
The open deck is simply amazing and is the best place in Kolkata to enjoy the riverside.
The view was amazing and so was the food. The starters were nice (potato wedges, naga chilli cheeze toast which we ordered). Hot cappuccino in the cool surroundings was refreshing and well made. There was thupka also in the soup.
The veg pizza with choice of any four toppings was thin and well done..
In the main  course we had north indian - it was super tasty and beyond expectations. 
We had also called for a live singer and stayed for five hours and had a lovely time throughout.  The deck was really well lit up and gave a festive feel after sunset.
Its a Great place to chill at sundown. They serve shisha on the open deck which one can enjoy with the view of the hooghly. They also have an indoor restaurant next to the deck with good sitting capacity.
Service was good and staff courteous.
The place has got a complete makeover after change in management and ownership and one can see the difference in food quality, the interiors and service. 
Definitely a place we would like to visit more often."
"I had visited the original Floatel several times and even hosted a party there while working in Kolkata some years ago. While most visitors appreciated the novelty of a floating hotel, the infrastructure was getting quite worn out. 

Lately, I was glad to hear that the property has been taken over and refurbished - especially because the new owners are the Polo Towers group. Having stayed in their flagship property in Shillong several times, I think highly of them. Hence my wife and I visited the renewed Polo Towers Floatel with high expectations – rather like meeting someone for the first time, having known both their parents! 

Our first impressions were quite positive. The reception area was attractively decorated and we were politely directed to the restaurant on the top deck when we said that we intended to have dinner. The décor and ambience were far better than they had been in the past. The whole setup looked vibrant and inviting. 

Since it was the weekend before Valentine’s Day, the hostess at the entrance of the restaurant offered us two choices for a buffet dinner: inside the restaurant and on the open deck outside it. Since it was a bit chilly, and the open deck was costlier, we chose to sit inside. The ambience was great and there was a marvellous view from the giant window near our table. 

Since no one came to our table for several minutes, we decided to help ourselves to the soup and starters. There was only one type of soup in the buffet – vegetable hot and sour. My wife declined it as she does not like very spicy stuff, but I ventured to try it and found that it was too hot for my tastes. Coming to the starters, the baby corn fritters were oily, cold and rubbery; ditto for the fried fish that my wife sampled. The main courses were quite lacklustre as well, except for the Thai style vegetables in coconut gravy. As for the desserts, the less said the better about the baked rasgullas. The ice cream was disappointing as well. 

While the food was below our expectations, the service was still worse. Although the restaurant had barely 30% occupancy, the servers chose to ignore us whenever we tried to attract their attention. After much effort, when a server reluctantly came to our table and we asked him for fresh rotis, he promptly passed on our request to a passing colleague, who chose to delay bringing our rotis till we lost all hope of ever getting them! By the way, the servers were dressed in light blue shirts and dark blue trousers which might have been intended to give a nautical appearance, but they ended up looking like disreputable security guards. Also, they had no name badges and so it was hard to distinguish them from each other. 

Incidentally, I discovered the source of distraction for the servers. When I stepped out onto the open deck to take a phone call, I found that uniformed servers were standing near the serving counter and happily puffing away on hookahs. I am a non-smoker and I do not have any objection if guests who smoke want to share their hookahs with the servers – but I find it intolerable that non-smoking guests seated in the indoor space get neglected because the servers on duty are continuously distracted by the lure of consuming tobacco on the deck. 

The worst was yet to come. While we tried to cheer up each other as we went through the disappointing meal and experienced the still more disappointing service, eventually we asked a passing server to get us the bill. Several minutes passed but no one responded. Finally, I went to the bar counter inside the restaurant where a credit card machine was visible, but the person manning the counter showed a marked reluctance towards using it. The charges per head were high, but since we had been told about them in advance, I cannot complain. However, I must emphasise that neither the food nor the service was worth the price – and if they had demanded a service charge, I would certainly have declined to pay it. 

As we were leaving, my wife called for the manager. After we had waited for several minutes near the exit, a man wearing a smart black coat put in an appearance. When we shared our disappointment with him, he heard us in silence with a wooden expression and did not offer a word of apology.

To conclude, I am prepared to give 4 stars for the hardware (i.e. the furnishing and décor), but no stars for the software (i.e. cooking and service). Go for the experience of dining on a real ship, but do not expect anything beyond the novelty factor – unless you want to indulge in the exorbitantly expensive pursuit of sharing a hookah on the open deck!"
"A truly nice place to  stay , on Anniversary we have stayed over this hotel, room is well maintained the Housekeeping manager Samiran took very good care of us on this event , I love to come back again and recomend others also for this property"
The location is the only USP of this place. The deck restaurant is great to spend an evening. But the experience of stay is not that good here. The rooms are small and crampy. The service is very poor. Even it is very hard to contact the reception. Foods are also overpriced.
"It was an amazing experience by ganga side, excellent ambience, service and food.
Diibya the sales manager was cordial and organised the event well, entire staff was helpful.
Highly recommended place."
"A quick stop at Floatel for no specific reason made my day a blissful one. I was low due to certain issues, wanted to spend sometime with self....a sudden visit...and a quality experience...that will surely last for long....as I watched the Sun plunging into the heart of Ganges for the day...I felt rejuvenated to the core..."
"It was a nyc stay,,hotel is in a nyc location and the hotel staff are excellent, special thanks to Mr Samiran ,Rita and Faruk from housekeeping who made my stay memorable. They made me fee like i am staying in my own home."
"Well it's a well known floating hotel on the banks attached to river Ganga..
The ambiance is so beautiful and relaxing.
The rooms have been beautifully furnished providing a graceful, yet homely ambiance for you to chill. Hotel has a strategic  location.
Anchorage hall can accommodate comfortably 200 people as they were in our guests list.
Food was not upto the mark as per standards of four star.
A great help and super effort was by the Banquet manager Mr. Dibya Tirtha Majumder many thanks to him. 
Breakfast was good , lots of variety on the menu, upper deck was awesome, feels like Titanic 
Over all a good deal."
Last Saturday I went to Floatel after almost three years. Loved the new renovated look of this place. The interior designs are awesome. The ambiance is fascinating. Enjoyed the beautiful sunset over the river from the open air deck. Loved the hospitality of Soumita. She was very helpful and courteous. Will certainly visit this place again...
"Must visit.. such a calming environment that one forgets one is in the heart of Kolkata's CBD, Dalhousie. Food is very nice, a special feature is their boat ride picnic which is super cool and absolutely insta-worthy."
"Had visited Kolkata on a personal trip...

Had heard about the place from my colleague, so jus went to try on... And the place didn't disappoint me at all..

Even exceed the expectations of mine. 

Really like the Chicken tikka and Prawn Prepration done by Chef.

Really appreciate the efforts from Mr. Sanjiban.

Will recommend other to try the place with amazing view and great Food."
"Right from the beginning to checkout.. the entire experience was simply splendid. The extra bit of personal touch was all throughout present. Got a river facing room without asking for it. Very courteous staffs, awesome authentic food and immaculate professionalism even at the odd hours. Highly recommended. I would like to appreciate entire fo team, specially komolika and pooja they were very helpful during my stay. Thanks a lot."
It was a very good experience.  Wonderful  boat ride. Sona and Subhas helped us and made this boat ride more easy for me and my family. The food was also very nice.Everyone  should visit once. All-over great experience.❤
"The entire staying was very good.. Meeting with Pratyusha was very good, we come to know about entire arrangements specially for couple. So we obviously plan for coming again and also will tell our friend to come either with family or their partner mainly who are newly married.."
"Stay was good, staff behaviour was also good, front desk people nature I liked that they are very helpful and supportive they help me for sometime which was my personal problem. Komolika and sudipta both girls from front office seriously awesome."
"Ambience was very good......
Awesome services. Staff are very helpful. Thanks sudipta and kamolika for your friendly nature and helpful attitude. I want to visit again with my family. Food was really awesome."
The boat ride was amazing. Special thanks to subhas kapat for helping us. The view of Ganga is very good from the restaurant in the 3rd floor. The outer deck has a very good ambiance and they are even going to open one more area at the top which has swings and chilling stuff
"Very nice experience

And we had good time

"Ambience was very good

Wonderful experience with you all especially Mr. Sona and his team. Beautiful views and lovely snacks. Time stands still at an experience like this. Wish it lasted longer. Recommend it for everyone who wishes to spend some quiet time
"We were a group of 8 friends stayed at this property with our spouses .The rooms ( Riverview Heritage & Riverview Cabin ) were excellent. They give you a feeling of cruise ship. However when you are in a group  it is quite obvious you would want to hangout together, for which except the restaurant there was no other place open for guests. So the choice was either you stay in your room as a couple  or have food together as a group in the restaurant. The most disturbing part was a ) they have plenty of open deck area available but for some reason didn't allow us...and b ) they have room with private deck which was comfortable for 6 to sit and 8 can also squeeze in...but at the time of reservation we were told the private deck is good for 4 persons to sit. Food  quality was excellent and special mention for Subhrajit & Sudipta at front office and Soumita and Sanjivan Maity and team at the restaurant for their service."
"I felt like a king!!!
"" I felt that I was staying in my own house ""
Extremely extremely super service....
Food, staff, many more things I have no words for describe..we were checked upon by housekeeping supervisor Miss Rita in morning regarding our stay..she was amazing and very attentive..overall excellent experience😊😊"
"Well on my 3rd Anniversary I took my Wife for the special 1 hr Boat Ride provided by Floatel. Its an exciting experience, good food and awesome views compliments the overall experience. Sona was responsible for taking care of us and he did a great job."
"Staying at  hotel Polo Floatel, The property is exceptionally well located, it was almost like staying in a cruise ship with bigger rooms, Staff was cooperative specially Komolika helped us a lot in Checking out, while Ibrahim helped us in checking in smoothly."
"Sona really made our experience hospitable & worthwhile. It was a delightful morning with a mesmerising view, delicious desserts & great tea! 

The booking procedure by the respective staff was also absolutely hassle free. Would definitely recommend."
"It was a great pleasure to be here. Lovely Ganges backdrop added to the beauty of the place. Great ambiance great service and great food. Special care taken by arpan, Riya srikumar joy and Suman........"
"Excellent support staff and quality food..Service by Arpan, Riya, Srikjmar , Suman and Joy were outstanding ...... I will strongly recommend all to visit here and will be here back again..Location is always great and so as the hospitality"
We tried the buffet at Floatel. It had a lot of good options and the food was very good. The view and ambience of the restaurant is also great and a treat to the eyes. This is a must visit when you are in Kolkata.specle Services  by Arpan and Riya. Joy and shreekumar....thanks
Great place and it’s such a lovely experience to see the Hooghly through your window when you wake up. The staff in the restaurant is so polite and helpful. Loved my stay here. The view is so dreamlike and rooms are so clean and comfortable. I would advise this place for both business as well as pleasure trips.

"Exemplary service. Eye for detail at every aspect. Hi-tea by the BRIDGE restaurant was exceptional, Food,Ambience,great staff and managers summed it up. 
Operations headed by Amit Kobat is at its best!!!!"
Best place to enjoy the sunset over the Ganges. Celebrated my brother's birthday. Food was good but more options in the snacks Menu is required. Hookah is available but they have not yet received the bar license. Service is good.
Stay was very comfortable. View was just amazing. Hotel staffs were very helpfull. The receptionist girl Sudiptaa was also very helpful.. She upgrade my room just for my one request. Basically my first time floatel visit experience was soooo excellent. Restaurant also well decorated. Morning buffet breakfast decoration was very nice along with service
"I will give 5 start for foods, hotel decoration, safety. Above all their staff hospitality..its too politely..i want to mentioned some of their name Arpan, Riya, Sona. My wife and me visited there for our second anniversary night spent. In one words its beautiful place for us."

Very nice ambiance. Great place to be with family..Sona the staff served as well . Great choice of food suggested by Sona . Good service . Food was good . Mocktail was tasty ..Soft music playing in the background
We had a sumptuous Sunday Brunch. Price was very reasonable and I specifically mention personalised service of Sona and Arpan. By the side of River Ganges it is in an ideal location for spending some quality time with family and enjoy the food.
"Excellent service by Sona and Arpan..
Food spread was good both veg and non veg.
Will visit the once again with family.
But should have more variety of Mocktails and beverages..

"Excellent experience and delicious food, well and decent service and house keeping , must visit place and can come to enjoy view of hoogli river and nearby places. Rooms are neat and well maintained.I enjoyed my experience here.
SONA ji service is really nice, thanks"
"Room booked: Suite with balcony
1. Despite keeping my arrival time pre-notified, the room was not ready. We were made to wait for around one and half hours even after the hotel's official check-in time before our room was ready;
2. Room was called ""Suite""! It was just an average room. Bed was very small for a family of 3 i. e. me, my wife and infant daughter.
3. It appeared that there was no regular upkeep of the room with dirty lighting panel, damp walls, balcony sliding door didn't shut properly and was very difficult to move;
4. TV wasn't functioning;
5. One chair in the balcony was rickety and the balcony was dirty as well with dust on the railings.
Overall, it was a very poor quality room which was being sold as ""Suite with balcony "".
Only good part was that the hotel manager was courteous and acknowledged that he had a new team who are still being trained on the job."
The ambience is very good. Especially the service offered by sona and Tapas wss very overwhelming. Food is  very good and yummy. I would like to come back again. The areal view is very awesome. Satisfied
"Visited Poloflotel for the first time . 
Had a great sundowner lunch with the view of Ganges and amazing foods with seesha. 
The service and hospitality is out of the world . 
Special thanks to Mr Sona, Mr Raj and Mr. Shree."
"Its an amazing place, with best view of ganges, the food quality is good,
Most importantly the kind of service they are providing is mindblowing superb am so much satisfied,
Specially
Sona Adarsh, Faiyaz  and Sree Kumar along with others.
They literally know how to deal with customers…just amazing.❤️"
Had a great time with my family. Very nice service. Nice ambiance by the River. Lemongrass chicken which was recommended to us is a must try. Highly recommend this place to everyone who would want to have a good time with friends and family on open. Sona and others served us and took us around the property.
"Enjoyed here very much.

Staff beheaviour was good. House keeping service were excellent specially from Chandan Mondal who attended our room. But the rooms were not well maintained and a makeover/renovation is definitely needed.
"Breakfast is decent. Don’t experiment much is my suggestion.

Eggs preparation - Scrambled, Omelette , Uttapa is good and a safe bet to order.

Sona and Jay from Restaurant staff are helpful and friendly. 

The security guard for room is a Kishore Kumar fan and welcomed us with a beautiful Kishore Kumar song!!

Rooms are smaller than we thought though we have the biggest room available with Private Deck."
"Food is excellent here and Sona and jayakrishna the crews were really humble and nice, they served us very well and I enjoyed the ambience. They have great desserts also. Also you should try their gajar ka halwa in the morning it's yum."
"Good hospitality by staff and good food bt little bit high price
The location is jst awesome
Atmosphere and ambience is great.
We njoy the 31st night with live music and
Happy to stay with my family.."
Sat on the deck and the ambience was great! Our server Arpan and Riya and Adrash and sreekumar were very professional and sweet. The food--boat fish and the coffee--with hints of cinnamon--were a treat! Would definitely come again!...
Visited Calcutta after two years from the Netherlands qnd had an amazing time with my sister. Riya and Arpan guided us to the open deck with a view of the river and nice music. The food and drinks were delicious! Would definitely visit again with more friends.
"An amazing celebration of the mother and son duo on the stacation vist at Polo Floatel.

The deckroom the fantastic food the impeccable hospitality was worth a 3 cheers and not to be missed.

The pictures say it all...

Thanks a bunch to Sayanti Sabeer Sreekumar the entire kitchen management headed by Chef  Gautam and the lovely table attendant ...the Captains Arun Joy Kopert .

Kudos to the entire team!"
Really a nice hotel. Inside the ship decoration was very beautiful. Rooms are little bit cozy but we'll decorated. Staffs are very polite and well mannered. Sudipta and komolika both the girls are very sweet and very helpful. Thanks both of you.. you are guys suggest me a good view room
"I have been planning this stay for some time now , and could finally get my wish fulfilled thanks to my wife’s birthday which I thought of a surprise visit to this heritage property in the heart of the city of Joy.

I booked the Heritage Room with a Private Deck and the room was beyond my expectations, absolutely decked , neat and clean , and yes the private deck was the icing on the cake where we spent most of the time.

Food is pretty scrumptious..and if you book a table @ The Bridge ,  you get a lovely view and an open sky..

Boat ride is a must , preferably sunset ride is the best , all safety protocols followed, sanitised, snacks and tea offered on the boat in heritage boxes would surely make you feel special.

Coming to service- it is top notch , greeting and wishing you with a smile always, every body would jump into to make your stay pretty worthy.

Special mentions to Sourav Mitra , Srikumar Bhattacharya, Sayanti , Soumita , Subhash Kapat  and Mr Sabir , thank you for the amazing service…"

Nice place with excellent service (Mr.Sona and Mr.Suman) .The ambience was very nice. We ordered fish fry and penne pasta in white sauce. The food was excellent in both quality and quantity. Overall very satisfied.
Brilliant ambience located between both iconic Calcutta bridges on the Ganges. Great food and love the attention paid to details in everything. Service by Sona was excellent. Would love to visit again.

Basically I visited at Kolkata for business purposes and I had stay at Polo Floatel. Stay was Such a wonderful and comfortable. All Staffs are well mannered. I had like to give a special thanks to Ms Sudipta who was in reception only. She was also very helpful and polite. Over all I want to give 5/5 rate to Floatel.
It was a wonderful experience. Staff was very nice and welcoming. Very fine snacks and drinks are served during the ride. Absolutely recommend to take the ride during sundown to see Calcutta in beautiful light. Five stars

"The floatel just as name suggests is afloat on hoogley river with scenic view . Able to have a good time with family. Its very serene ! And enjoyed a lot with good food at the hotel. The hospitality of hotel staffs arpan, riya, and sabir were very welcoming."
"Love the place... One of the best place in town... Arpan is very smart guy who earned this review with him hospitality... Other names to mention is Restaurant Manager Suman, Tapas and none other than Soumen Halder, General Manager and my old friend... Food is excellent... Service is top notch..."
"It’s been renovated well. However, there is no way you will be able to sleep at night. It’s got wooden walls and anyone in the whole floor opening or closing a door is going to make it feel  Like it’s happening in your room. It’s just way too noisy. 
Also there is no area apart from the room and the restaurant where you can hang out. It’s a unique place and you are just Better off going there for a meal rather than staying over night.  
There should have been a private area for in-house guests. 
Breakfast spread is average but the service is good."
I like the ambiance and arrangement is nice and exotic. Liked the taste of food. Both of us have really enjoyed the stay and brunch  at  Floatel. Thanks to Suman and his team. (Arpan. Riya.Sona and Joy)
"Great food, excellent hospitality and stunning views! Grateful to the restaurant crew particularly Soumita and Sona whose care made our dining experience all that more special. Highly recommend a visit!"
"Ambience is very nice.. and the food quality is also decent. Sona, dharmendar and Arun was very nice to us. They served us the food and treated us very well. We are very satisfied with their services."
"Great Ambiance  as well as quality  of food . Great service by Sona, Jay and Arpan . The rate was reasonable  and the place is very classy. The place was very nice.restaurent manager Mr Suman also very nice person."
"Lunch was excellent , food quality  100/100, good music and cleanliness  also,  great service  by Riya, Arpan,  Suman restaurant  manager  they take  care of us and Riya have good smelling,

"When searching a suitable place to arrange a family get together and banquet on 27th November 2021, to celebrate my son’s marriage, Polo Floatel fascinated me most by its convenient location and unique identity of being a hotel on a barge, floating on the Kolkata’s ancient lifeline, Ganga. 

My guests were just a select hundred in number and so, from among five options Polo Floatel offered me, I hired their “Compass hall & deck”, about 2500 sq ft combination of half AC hall and half open deck which matched my requirement best. I also booked two river-side sunset cabins to serve as retiring rooms for any of my guests if so be needed.

The occasion created a lasting impression among my guests. The ambience of the place was unparallel. Sales Executive Miss. Sayanti Das coordinated the whole program, starting from the introductory talks at the front desk a month ahead, through finalizing the menu by conferencing with Cheff Mr. Sujan, upto personally supervising the event till 10 pm on the date of the occasion, by teaming up with Mr. Sabbir, the highly efficient in-charge of the venue. No word of praise can match their service.

Ours was a traditional Bengali family event and the full course dinner, comprising 23 items from welcome drink to desserts, charmingly harmonized with the taste of my guests. Qudos to Cheff Mr. Sujan."
"Food is extremely good.good ambience.staff are friendly .special mention to Sabir,rioia and Arpan.nice and cosy place.Good for couples.winter time is the best.open space also.feels awesome in this winter."
"Good place to visit....nice ambiance...tasty food and staffs was very carefull specilly riya ,arpan, sweety, sabir , priyanka and dharmendra . They are too good person ... 
 Breakfst was too good speically choclate milkshake"
"The food, service, music was extremely good, would love to visit again with friends. The view was breath taking. The staffs behavior was very courteous and Soumita gave us one of the best seats on the deck. Loved it!"
Its a wonderful stay at the hotel. The room was nicely decorated in heritage style and also the lobby and the restaurant all are nicely maintained. Food is a little expensive though but thats worthy on a place like this. Would like to come again.
"Centrally located. Rooms are good. Had a great family time. Great service provided by Soumita, JoyKrishna, Suman. Food was also fairly good. They arrange additional boat rides etc on request. Overall, great experience."
I had a wonderful experience while having lunch in Floatel restaurant. Quality of food and ambience were both fantastic. Treatment that I received there from the staff was unprecedented. I recommend this place. Specially thanks to Riya and Jay..
"Floatel has recently undergone a renovation and it has given the property the much needed facelift. The decor alongwith the plush furnishings give a contemporary chic vibe. The river view rooms have great view of the Ganges and the iconic Hoogly bridges. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay thanks to the superb hospitality of Mr. Chandan Mondal who promptly catered to all our requests and Ms. Sudipa at the front desk for her the warm and helpful attitude.
The food and breakfast buffet spread was impressive as well.
A bit on the downside, the rooms are small.  However, the view being the major drawing point compensates for it."
"It has been a wonderful experience. Team Floatel has created an enchanting experience especially for a beautiful boatride with all the exquisite amentities with a blissful dinner service with plethora of food options for all kind of tastebud creating a wholesome wonderful evening and great experience. Thank You very much Ms.Soumita, Mr.Abhijit, Mr.Danish, Mr.Suman for this wonderful experience."
"The lemon grass chicken & Tigershrimp stired fry and pink elephant mocktail  we tried over there it was such nice taste 
Soumita hleping alot of suggestion. Thanku flotel for our lovely evening 
 This is best place we ever had"
"Hirak (housekeeping) was very co-operative, attentive, helpful, amiable, and courteous. All amenities were given on time. And everything was taken care of.

"It’s been a lovely experience with the team of Marriott here in Kolkata. Good location in the newly built district of the city, not hectic at all, a nice market nearby. Mall with a good grocery store is just in a walking distance. 
The hotel team is very attentive and friendly to guests. Breakfast is very good, variety of choice for all tastes. Could not try the in-room dining as the QR code in the room was not active, and no one picked up the phone at the restaurant late in the evening.
Rooms are in a good shape, very well served and cleaned - many thanks to the housekeeper Hirak Mondal. I liked everything, it’s worth it. "
"Amazing service provided the staff specially by Mr. Hirak from houskeeping department who was very polite and soft spoken and fulfilled all our requests on time. 
It was a great stay and I loved it
Thankyou so much Fairfield."
I would like to thank Mr. Hirok Mondal for taking good care of us and would like to congratulate Farefield Marriott to have such an amazing and hard working employee. Thankyou to each one of you to make our sstay comfortable.
They gave us a big surprise by celebrating my birthday with cakes balloons and room decorations.  It made me feel special  The rooms are quite nice and the break fast was just right. The gym was also quite good.  The ambience was wonderful.  The view outside gives a nice skyline
It's a pleasant stay. Hotel staff too polite n professional.  Outmost cleanliness maintained which made the stay safe and comfortable.  Food served an extra happiness and care. Thank you to all hospitality team from desk till door. 🙏

"Discovered the hotel on the net, read the recommendations and had booked the room online through Bonvoy app. Very smooth booking. 
Well located hotel in the hub of New Town, next door to Vishwa Bangla Gate (an iconic landmark of Kolkata. 
All the staff are cheerful and very helping in nature.
The buffet breakfast was not too good in certain aspects on the first day. I had filled up the feedback form. Immediately the issues were sorted out and the next 3 days we had an excellent breakfast. It's a great thing to see your feedback points are being acted upon.
The rooms are cosy. the view from our room was excellent. could see the hanging restaurant from our room.
Missed the shaving mirror. Would ask the management to install the magnifying mirror in all the rooms.
A great host out for the Chef and also a bigger shout out for Sunipa, who looked after us so well during the breakfast time on all days.
A special thank you to Subrata from house keeping, who spelled out magic in decorating and cleaning our room.
a great stay indeed."
"Excellent is the only word appropriate for this property. Decent rooms with all facilities, mind blowing food and beverages and above all extra courteous staff. Cleanliness, check-in and check-out, Valet parking and housekeeping was commendable. Special thanks to Ritika, Biswas and Supavam for their always smiling face and greetings and arranging special cake for my wedding anniversary. Kudos to all and will surely visit again. "
"Quite possibly, this is the best business hotel I have experienced. Starting from check -in, moving on to service in Kava, and housekeeping - what was unique was the genuine warmth exuded by all the staff. The room was perfect for my work - wifi available on all my 3 devices. This is the first hotel in India that I have been to where the HD channels on the TV were active! Breakfast quality was excellent, and Chef Bobby at Kava served a delectable mutton biryani on 14th evening. Mention must also be made of Ritika, Sharmila and Saurabh - really excellent service with the right amount of attention and chat. I have no hesitation in stating that my next visit to Kolkata will not see me lodge in any other hotel but the Fairfield by Marriott. My compliments to the management."

"The hotel property is close to the airport and half way through even if you need to get to the central Kolkata.

Saurav, Binita, Suvopam and Sharmila are awesome people. They will go the extra mile to make you comfortable. I was offered Bengali cuisine on my special request even though I was there for enjoying the buffet selection, which was anyway very good."
We went our anniversary lunch at the Fairfield not only we are amazed by the cordial hospitality but also for sure the quality of the food. In spite of the buffet they gave us specially packed food.😊
"We visited the vertex restaurant for the first time.  Decent ambience (the flickering lights can be annoying), great music, fabulous drinks (mint all day mocktail and chardonnay) prepared by Saad (the bartender). The pork and chicken pizza was well made.

I would recommend it to a friend and visit again."
"This Hotel is near to my office and I visit frequently, Miss Binita took care of us nicely. She talk clear about food n service, like my daughter, she behave very familiar with all guests. Nice Hotel..!

Food quality is very good, items are nice"
"Fairfield by Marriott is one of the best hotels in Kolkata.
The location Newtown area is a great location, with nice amenities and away from the city's havoc.
The rooms here are perfectly sized and very comfortable. Keeping its name and brand at its peak, the hotel takes care of hygiene very seriously and keeping in mind the covid situation around the world staying here felt very safe to me. The floors and all the places are sanitized from time to time which is very nice. The cleaning staff especially Sandip Bhattacharya Ji, are very polite and great at their work, they have never disappointed in regards with their work.
The dining experience was great with a nice and wide variety of delicacies available. The area has polite staff including Nikita who is always there to help. The place has a nice view of the city which feels great to have with morning breakfast.
The place has a pool area which also has a calm and almost scening view"
"Excellent facilities ,well organised events,delicious food, good room service.
Special mention to Ms payal ganguly, Mr Manjeet singh& Mr pradeep for their unending support & hospitality during our stay"
We went to Fairfield (vertex) today for some quality time and it was a great experience. All credits to Mr. Babu for great hospitality and support. 😀loved the chilly prawn. Kudos to chef 👨‍🍳and loved the hookah as well.

"Had a wonderful time at Vertex... It was our first time post the pandemic and was absolutely amazing! Chandan, from customer service, was an absolutely delight. Would definitely recommend for a safe evening out in the open air dreamy Vertex."
Chandan and arindam hospitality make you feel like home. Drinks and food is amazing. Service is at its best. great company and excellent bartender! You just have to come to see him in action and taste his drinks :-)
Vertex is amazing place to visit if you are in Kolkata specially mention Saad and Chandan food and cocktails must try things about place it has amazing ambience and live music is rocking if you’re planning to party best place to make your day awesome
I had a great stay at Fairfield by Marriott Kolkata. The rooms are spic and span maintained by Ramprasad. He kept the rooms everyday arranged and as per my preferences.  The clothes are folded and room is perfectly  cleaned by him . Thanks for his hospitality.  Also the other staffs at the restaurant  is very cooperative  and friendly. The food also tastes very nice . The view is superb of the new town . Overall a great stay at the hotel maintaining all covid protocols. Thank-you everyone from making the stay memorable . Coming back soon
"Awesome | Bingo | Refreshing Lifestyle

Whenever I come to Kolkata, I used to stay in Fairfield Marriott only. As because their ambience is good with a view of ""Biswa Bangla Gate"", services and hospitality provided by their staffs, it always helps in refreshing memories and exchanging gratitude. 

This hotel is managed by a team of young and enthusiastic professionals. They are always ready to make you feel like home. The whole staff is friendly but some important names are :-

1. Chandan Chakraborty (vertex)
2. Saad (vertex)
3. Priyam Biswas (pool area)
4. Sanu Gozdar (housekeeping)
5. Roopak (Chef)

All of them serves us as their best manner with a smile on their faces. Thank you and looking forward for my next stay with Fairfield by Marriott Kolkata. "
"This was my 2nd stay here and once again the team made sure to give us a perfect stay experience. The team at Kava is exceptional at their hospitality. Specail mention to Sunipa, Shenu, Rajiv, Chef Bobby, Ankit Bhaat, Saurav for their personal attention and extended warmth.
Thanks to their friendly gesture my 7 year old daughter has made may friends whom she will always remember."
"There was so much to be thankful for about our experience at Fairfield Marriott in these past few days. Your support helped us pull off a successful meeting with fabulous time & service.

Thank you for being such a hospitable and kind host!

Special mention to the dedicated and diligent staff- Kazi, Babu Shona, Sutanuka, Niharika, Joy and definitely Pradip Da, who were available at our service 24x7, we can't thank you enough. 
A memorable experience indeed.
Looking forward to meet you all soon! :)"
"We went for Lunch buffet on Saturday.
Taste of food - good
Services - Excellent, Friendly in nature
Variety of food was very less, no much option as Buffet Lunch
Covid protocol was maintained properly."
"Hi

Checked in hotel and find everything is as per Marriot promise...

I am G4 Radisson member and do stay at marriot only  when Radisson properties are not available.

However I will stay again and again at Fairfield marriot Kolkata just because I a m delighted by hospitality and personal service by ""Mr. Arindam Chakrabarty"" executive at lounge.

He such a friendly to all guest and I am just wondering how he learnt such a hospitality skill and understand how to win guest heart.

He is Gem of all members and Kudos to him.

Wish him a long professional life with marriot.

Also would like to praise Rakesh at kava who is also assets to marriot 

Arindam and Rakesh  ---Keep it up dear 😊"
"Service andd hospitality of the Kava was very nice. Special thanks to Binita ,Rajesh ,Seenu and Sharmila  for making our stay very convenient. I was there for about 20 days and every meal was fabulous and  ambience was luxury. Hygienic staff and quality of food was excellent. A must visit place for vacation and stay."
"After the first day of office when i came back i saw my t shirts that i left lying here n there (i can’t even remember where i left them) were well folded and placed properly. And i was like did they really folded my tshirts??
Later day i found out the room cleaning guys names ram prasad and sanu used to do it.
The hospitality is way superior than i imagined. The dining which they call kava is awesome. I liked the staff there too. They were too humble. Even for our own mistakes like quoting the wrong table while placing order they used to apologise for the inconvenience caused. The tone and words they use shows there sense of being a humble professional.
I’m really glad i chose to stay here for my business visit"
I would like to stress on the behaviour of housekeeping staff Sanu who was very helpful and responsive. As a whole the hotel's amenities were great. Special mention would be the restaurant Kava and it's staff's polite behaviour.
"Checked-in at 4th of September 21, The front office staff Raja helped me with the Checkout, Chandan from Vertex L2 and Binita from Kava L1 made my F&B experience fantastic. Thank you and looking forward for my next stay with Fairfield by Marriott Kolkata. The only thing upset me was that the Hotel does not sell Cigarettes. Kindly carry your own and bless me later."
Sanu gozdar he is an excellent housekeeping worker pleasure well mannered diseplen and asset to the organization kindly take care of him and rajesh good human being pleasent very well dressed excellent manners very caring and like a family man who takes care of guest superbly he is the nation to your hotel and chain pls take care of him
It was a very comfortable stay. The kava section was great offering varieties of food and Miss Ritika was a really great assistant throughout. The service was to the point and rooms were satisfying. It's a great place to stay for any occasion.
"The hotel certainly didnt feel like a Fairfield property but felt more like a basic luxury leisure hotel. The first impressions and initial experiences around the property did blow me away. But they gradually started exposing the typical elements of a Fairfield in various areas. Like the Room design, the fittings in the room, the quality of food etc. But at the price I paid, and the location I am not complaining! I would have given this hotel a 3 star rating  for sure, if not for the wonderfully attentive service I was showered with. That alone lifted it up to 4 stars. But they really need to pay attention to how they are implementing their covid protocols. They were flouting it more than embracing it appropriately.

LOCATION: Lovely location next to the iconic BISWA BANGLA gate.

DINE + DRINK: The VERTEX bar is a great place for an alfresco sundowner or a late evening lounge session indoors.  The Breakfast was a super crowded affair and almost scared me out of the restaurant. They could have certainly done a better job of showcasing some regional food. But instead the selection was all over the place and too many cuisines were combined to please the typical crowd looking for variety.  So they compromised on quantity over quality! The room service food was also not something to write about. But it was manageable.

ROOM: We stayed in 602, which is a SUITE room,  so this review is based on that; VIEW: Sweet view of the Cityscape ; SIZE: Very spacious suite with a living room and big bedroom; AIR-CON: Perfectly functioning cooler that helped in setting the perfect room temperature; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part to put me to sleep; BATHROOM: Stand in shower; TOILETRIES: Lovely Spa quality cosmetics by INNIS brand

FACILITIES: Compact Gym with a basic range of weights and Cardio machines good for a basic workout. But the machines were by a super local brand, so dont expect too much. Swimming pool was closed during my stay, but it did look great.

SERVICE: Friendly staff that took care of all my needs with a smile and made us feel pampered and well taken care of. Special Shout out to Argo at the front office and Rahul Kotekar(F&B head) for making the welcome experience wonderful. Excellent service by CHANDAN at the vertex bar and NEHA( Restaurant in-charge) making me feel at home!

HOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free Wi-Fi, but VERY PATCHY and quite slow at times! So forget about working from here. I had a lot of issues with my virtual meetings, and had to switch to my mobile 4G connection!!!! HUGE Plasma TV screen dishing out dozens of channels spanning sports, news, music, movies and a wide variety of entertainment in multiple languages

COVID UPDATE: Huge Area for Improvement!!!! They were doing a very shoddy  job of ensuring safety , social distancing and hygiene that was required to minimise the risk of spreading covid. . The Common areas and restaurants were especially scary places to be in!"
Resturent which is kava here is very nice.. they provide very good quantity of food in room dining and the services are really good.. thanks to mr Biswas for always taking care of us. Only the reception guys needs to get trained again on customer service .. rest all is Awsm
IT was a lovely experience.  Staffs were super sweet specially ritika singh. She is very helpful and polite. Rooms were nice and food were good. Thank you all of you. All the best . See you at the top. Cheers
"All of my friends went to stay on a football match day. Check in little late however got assistant quickly.
The rooms were nice 
The staff were helpful 
The food was delicious trust me credit goes to room service even at late night we were getting all the requirements fulfilled.
Cheers to all"
"This hotel is managed by a team of young and enthusiastic professionals, who will ensure to make your stay comfortable. 

Rooms - We stayed here for a week on the 5th floor (Room no 510).  The rooms were very clean and cozy. The view of New Town from the room was splendid!

Food -  The breakfast buffet included many options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The in-room dining experience could improve in terms of food preparation, as we had faced a few glitches here and there, but the prompt service and amends made up for it. 

Service - We were quite impressed with the service and hospitality we received from all the staff, right from check-in to check out. On checking in, we requested for a specific TV channel that wasn't subscribed to, and they were kind enough to recharge it for the entire duration of our stay. Also, the overall service was very quick and prompt, which made our stay really comfortable. 

Amenities - Due to the State restrictions, few amenities (like the pool and gym) were shut. However, when a few restrictions were lifted, they promptly complied and let us use the gym at a specific time. 

Special Mentions - A few people we'd like to mention - Atreyee from the front desk - who was very quick to respond to any issues related to the room, Sunipa from the restaurant - who checked on us regularly and made our breakfast and dining experience worth remembering, Binita from the restaurant - who remembered our preference for beverages, and made sure to serve it to us every day without us even having to ask! Also, Rajeev Ranjan (Banquet Manager), was prompt to solve any queries and issues that we had. 

All in all, we really enjoyed our stay here, and I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Kolkata and would surely go back here the next time I visit myself!

Sunny"

Thanks for every thing"
"I stayed at Fairfield for a duration of 4 days. The stay was simply amazing. The services by the hotel were extraordinary. Especially, we have found the Front Desk staff Suyash, Rajiv and the in room dining manager Pradip to be very helpful. Suyash arranged us packed breakfast everyday before we left to work. This kind of service offered by the Fairfield hotel was truly amazing and very warm. They have provided their services in a dedicated manner and tried their best to resolve any kind of issues we had. The in room dining services have been very useful, and thoughtful considering the pandemic. The room was clean and every day room service sanitized our room. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone who is dropping off in Kolkata. The hotel is in Newtown and is close to the US consulate and the Airport and many other malls. I would like to stay again here, if I ever visit Kolkata 💯. Fairfield simply left us with an excellent experience!"
"Being a bonvoy member a chose this hotel to stay in kolkata. Conveniently located near Biswa Bangla gate, near to airport and 30 minutes drive from the park Street.
Restaurant is nice with limited variety for breakfast and dinner. Special mention for Saurav dutta for his nice behaviour.
Overall a good stay for business travellers if you're in Newtown."
The service of the hotel is fantastic & top notch. Their Banquet manager Mr. Rajeev Ranjan was very co operative & ever helpful. We got delicious food prepared by Chef Arabinda Seth & Chef Bobby. All the staff were very courteous & polite. Check in check out process was smooth. The property & it's staff exceeded our expectations. Highly recommended for everyone to visit.
"Really awesome experience with this hotel. That's why it was my second visit. The entire staffs' services were really worthy. Ms.Prachi,Mr. kazi, Mr. Pradip & rest all staffs,they all were so professional & good. Just want to share one more thing that is I ordered 1 cake & hence they did not have the in house bakery they arranged it from WestIn on time & the cake was soooo good & tasty . Really Good , hygiene maintained."
"It was a wonderful experience though it was short stay however the experience was pretty good, thanks to Raja, Khatib and Gunjan from front office, Breakfast was really good which I liked and the service was very fast so special thanks to Ritika and Prasenjit..will be visiting again.

Regards,

"I had a very good experience at Fairfield Marriott. I accidentally booked a day in advance by mistake. After reaching the venue even though a new joinee told me nothing can be done, Gunjan the manager at that time got on a call with me and tracked down a rep from makemytrip and finally helped me prepone the booking. A big thank you to Mr Gunjan ! 

When I checked in at 1am in the night, due to COVID and severe surge in Kolkata , few users were unavailable as the chef specialized more in Indian that Italian, yet Mr Tanmay managed to get made a wonderful chicken spaghetti for me and made that complimentary as I had a really long day.

For the next day's breakfast, the restaurant team (a lady) took a mental note all my orders. The same food I wanted from inside the kitchen and not the food displayed outside because of the pandemic. She didn't skip a single dish delivered all of it at a distant table which I got re-sanitized and sat down. 

Fairfield's team & staff are humble , caring, empathetic & hardworking. It was priced at 3.6k (inclusive tax and breakfast) on MMT. I just got lucky to have found that hotel ! Truly a 5star ! "
"Being a non-resident guest, the Hotel and its staff, Raja Chowdhury has won my heart. My best friend, Tauseef Shiekh had checked in and I was unable to make it for his birthday. 
The least I could do was to have a cake sent across, which I did. And a BIG thank you to Raja Chowdhury for being such an approachable and helpful person. He put a smile on the face of a Hotel's Guest but most importantly, made it possible for me to make my best friend's birthday more special even in my absence. Thank you once again 😃"
"Binita, Sharmila, and Suvendu did an excellent job serving us. They made us feel so comfortable and helped us refresh from our tiring day :)
Really thankful to them for making it better for us. Hopefully, the next time I come here, they are also here."
"The services and attitude of Ms. Sharmila, Ms. Binitha, Ms. Ritika, Ms. Alisha, Mr. Rajesh, Mr. Saswat, Ms. Tamishra,  were excellent. Their contribution in attending the guest is highly appreciated. Wishing them better future and growth."

Short stay for us. But loved the property! Rooms are good.Looking forward to coming back again. Suyash from Guest relations was really warm and welcoming and made sure that our stay was pleasant and Fantastic!
"I am staying here for a longer time. I have given review already. Wanted give one more review as things changed from some time.I cannot say enough about the level of customer service, they are simply amazing. 
I am taking a few names that I remember who have helped me. However, its not just the one's I have named but all of them want to ensure your comfort.
A few that stand out are Anjali, Chef Bobby, Chef Biswajit, Chef Dipankar Amanpreet and  
the service from the associates and executives ( Mr Saumik , Mr Argha, Mr Tanayjit, Ms Sumana, Ms Ritika, Ms Vinita ) is good as always. They are very patient and pamper me so much.

Most importantly the hotel was following all the safety protocols regarding COVID-19. It was just a perfect stay in such difficult times . The service of the hotel is very precise, they know exactly what the customer wants. Thanks to the hotel team, Will definitely visit again."
"Visited Vertex with my friends! View of the restaurant, food, service, staff no words to compliment the same. Outstanding Pizza by Chef Panja and Suman. Will definitely visit again! Team Vertex keep it up."
"I stayed here twice in March on 25th and 27th. Appreciable job done from check-in to check-out, clean and tidy rooms, good food and laundry on time.

Special thanks to very friendly Kawa staff Prasanjit and Ritika as they create Gastronomic extravaganza and the dining experience a memorable one.

Both days I got late from work and entered restaurant at buffet closing time. Your staff are always there to go out of the way and help for whatever you want.
Best wishes to all your staff, specially the two mentioned above."
"The general upkeep is very good .The reception by employees was marvellous two of them one Mr, Rajiv Ranjan of Kava restaurant & a trainee named Sshubhra are really praiseworthy.
                  Howsoever reaching my floor by lift was really a cumboresome exercise as the card needs to be swiped & then the lift would accept the floor request .How so ever if your partner stays in room then you won't have the magnetic card & this created hell of the problem to either of you.This must be viewed seriously & nos. of cards provided must match the number of occupants in each room."
"Food was excellent stay was comfortable. Thanks to mr Rahul kotekar,  chef Ankit, chef arabindo, ms Ritika, Sunipa , rajesh, Sourav, Binita and mr Rajeev and neha ,chef bobby. And housekeeping trainees and staff were also excellent. Comfortable stay🎉🎉🎉"
"My room No. 429  was clean and hygienic. Stay was very nice and satisfying. Mr. Sanu from housekeeping  GSA took good care. 
Mr. Neeeraj panchal housekeeping Executive also took good care. Recommend this hotel to everyone."
"The property has everything you need during your stay - new, fresh rooms, - great location if you are visiting New Town, one great restaurant and one roof top bar 

Hospitality:
- Every one wears masks (covering nose and mouth)
- greets with smile and respect
- recognizes your priorities and provides quick and efficient service
- Housekeeping was great, fresh clean rooms and at times decorated with towel origami
- Front desk took care of our check-in, upgrade and efficient checkout
- Restaurant staff went above and beyond preparing food to our taste and personally checking on us

We recognize the effort from Rahul, Sunipa, Neha, Bobby and others

Our experience:
My wife and I stayed at this property for two full weeks (14 days). We were first upgraded to an executive room on the 5th level with a great view. Then after 4 days we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely

Disclaimer - we are on top tier Marriott status level, hence we give a lot of business to Marriott chain of properties and as a result get top privileges such as ""room upgrades"""
"If you are looking for a fine hotel with excellent service and professionalism, then fairfield  by marriot is the place. The hotel is beautiful and the people are extremely helpful and friendly. Kava is the restaurant and is a must try for dining. Special thanks to Jr. Sous Chef Mr. ANKIT BHATT, for being extremely kind and accommodating. The food prepared by him for my engagement was remarkable, gaining extreme appreciation by all our guests. If you are ever eating in kava do make it a point to tell your personal requirements for food to the chef and he will never let you down. Special thank you to Gurmehar, Saad Ahmad and Jessica Sahay who were willing to understand all our requirements for the engagement in a very accomodating manner and catering to all our needs.
People here dont forget you even if you have been their guest just for a day and they meet, greet and deliver a 5 star experience for you everytime you meet them.

I am extremely pleased by the people and the hotel and definitely recommend the place for my fellow travellers."
Chandan has been such a good friend and a such  a such server. Please look for him.loved the ambience. I loved the food and such a great ambiance and again the place was amazing . I loved the noodles and the paneer roast
"Everything was good in the property.
Areas of improvement:
-Something need to be done to Stop flies entering into room.
-Breakfast fast spread was less.

Thanks Mr Rahul(F&B ) head to provide courteous and delightful service in regard to listening small concerns and providing immediate resolution for the same.
Will surely recommend this to everyone if anybody wants to stay near Airport or Salt Lake.
"
"Good comfortable rooms, warm and hospitable reception, courteous staff, all was going decently well. Then the experience at the Cafe during breakfast time - majority of guests not wearing masks, everyone was handling the buffet, what was shocking was food which was fallen on the counter was picked up by the Chef and put back into the buffet, uniforms of their training staff was like it was never washed, though when brought all this to the notice of the manager corrective action was taken immediately. But why wait for an issue to be told, why there wasn’t any attention to detail by the team members. Why can’t the staff try or put some effort to ensure guests wear masks when at buffet. Ignorance is never bliss in such time that we are all facing. All was going well till this last episode which shattered the experience in bits."
"The food choices are very limited. Surprised to see very few local dishes. Bengali sweets got over at 9.30 pm. 
Very bad service. Chef Arabinda was arguing instead of finding solutions for the poor service and breakfast"
"I keep on visiting kolkata specially in this hotel, staff i really appreciate , friendly nature, approachable, special thanks to Seenu this tym , she made my evening by this lovely gesture that too when i was craving for  🤗🤗 thanks dear"
We had amazing time at The Vertex. This has a verandah with beautiful seating arrangements. Live Music was both soothing and lively. Offers great food with  pan Indian and continental choices. Chef Vishwajit and his team made it a memorable evening for us
"I was given a room after waiting x 6 hours at the Fairfield by Marriott Kolkatta
My keys don’t work, the duty manager Arghya Sarkar was absolutely rude and inhospitable 
Told me it’s my fault that the keys don’t work
Other guests came down with me to report the same issue and then he had nothing to say and disappeared in his back office 
Trainee at the front desk least apologized and  acknowledged that they are facing a problem with the keys getting deactivated !

Not a good experience at all
At the breakfast table they forgot to serve me coffee that I had requested 
Absolutely pathetic service 

Room -# 437

"I actually don't know where to start from. Whether I should start from amazing ambience, welcoming guestue of all the people of vertex or with world class service of Mr. Chandan Chakraborty and our Chef Biswajit. 

Woaah! What a memorable stay it way from soft and smooth hospitality to Mint on the Rock drinks, with random no of Taquila shorts consumed with them vibe suitable sound from the DJ in the glass House Mr. Ajay all these were not enough to pamper us enough so, Mr. Pradip and Mr. Gourav also came in. Such good coordination the team has with particular details being taken care in out every serve, we felt like a family to themselves. 

It was glad to stay, with such gentle and warm hearted atmosphere. Due to my privacy and security concerns I won't be able to share my image but I would share it of our team, which we captured to make this trip memorable so that we can recall the moments after years. 

I would suggest you to definately visit this place if you are in Kolkata and if possible you should arrange the stay in weekends as they have blissful evenings with live music and thundering DJ at the end, which can make your vibes move towards positive energy , which helps your in creating a better environment for yourself, resulting it into becoming a better world. 

People you should know before you visit Vertex / Fairfield Marriot, Newtown, Kolkata. 

1. Mr. Chandan in Vertex
2. Mr. Pradit in Vertex
3. DJ Ajay in Vertex
4. Mr. Gourav near pool area
5. Chef Biswajeet

Apart from this, their whole team is just amazing and filled with surprises to make your trip memorable.

I being a Gujarati, we can't forget to give tip to the people who wins our heart. But this team, OMG they don't accept the tips! Even after forcing them up for a long time!
They just care for your lovely and comfortable stay. 

If I plan my trip to Kolkata, the first thing I do is, I ask my secretary to reach out to Vertex in Fairfield Marriot, Newtown and ask them to connect me to Mr. Chandan for reservation of my table for Friday and Saturday, if there are no other private bookings. Then my next step is to book flight tickets for Kolkata. "
"The hotel is a new property and is perfect for a business trip. The hotel entrance is facing the side road and  so one can't easily see it from the main road. The check-in was smooth and professional. The rooms are very good with all amenities. The rooms are slightly on the smaller side but wouldn't matter for 1 or 2 persons occupancy. They had an excellent HD television with almost all channels available. Breakfast has a good spread with even a maggi counter for the kids. They also have a vending machine with some snacks and drinks at the lobby. Finally, full marks for the staff attitude, politeness and eagerness to assist with your requests. The tariff is also very reasonable considering the Marriott brand."
"Recently we hosted my friend's birthday party at Vertex & Fairfield team ensured it was a night to remember. Amazing hospitality, excellent service, good food and great music. Everything was as agreed & absolutely perfect. A special mention to Mr. Rajiv & Mr. Chandan. Their attitude towards guests & keeping their demands deserves a big thumbs up !!! To sum it up all i can say is despite our best drunken efforts we could not get a ""No""from them. Keep it up guys."
"Excellent dining , awesome taste n hospitality by chef Biswajit & serving aid gaurav.
Such a brilliant experience that we had ..made my sisters bday truly exhilarating. 
Must try cheese cake, chilly chicken, malai kofta, butter chicken n aloo gulistani. 
Highly recommended. "
"Recently visited Vertex with friends to spend the evening.. 
Good food , very good ambiance
Special thanks to Chandan Saad who attended us and chef Biswajit who suggested us some really good dishes.
Looking forward to visit again soon.."
Had a pleasant stay staff is very curitious and helpful. Hotel is clean and sanitized fully felt safe and cared. The amenities are of European standards. Just that some items are missing like slippers and in double room one towel had to aske for it.
I had gone there for a staycation with my wife on our Anniversary. They upgraded us to executive room which was very kind of them. The pillows in the rooms were badly stained and we had to call room service to change them. We thought of checking the bed sheets as well and to our horror the entire sheets were stained and they were just tucked inside.. never expected such a service from Marriot.. The breakfast spread was delicious but the dinner spread was average. Had to ask for non- veg starters and there was 1 lady who was their during the dinner time who does not deserve to be in hospitality. Another customer wcomplained about her at the reception desk as well. Not expected this from Marriot hotels..
Wonderful experience and delightful service by staff of Cava restaurant. Ritika and her colleagues looked after us very well all through our leisurely lunch on a Saturday. Thanks so much. Will be back soon.
"Great hospitality, good food and very good location. The rooms which face the Biswa Bangla circle are the best to stay. One point which was not good was without checking the details we were asked in restaurant to sign the bills for breakfast even though we had Free breakfast included in the package."
Been there for dinner. The array of dishes in buffet was quite good. The decor and ambience is great couple with it are the courtesy of the staffs. Special thanks to Gourab and Ritika for taking care.
Stay with them at regular basis .very well handled in room dining by Simran Joshi .expeditious and a good job .All the criteria full filled and service was bang on time .Simran was a pleasure to deal with .
Excellent! The snacks and coffee are excellent and Ankita is knowledgeable and a kind and helpful lady. So is Anuska. The items are fresh and new. A tough competition to kookie jar. I liked the hazel nut coffee ☕.
"Nice comfortable place for business stay, good, professional, soft spoken employees, always ready to assist wenever required … big Shoutout to SIMRAN (inroom dining) you rock girl… keep up the good work."
"Had a great overall experience. Their spa and fitness facilities have always been outstanding!

"The staff is courteous and very helpful.
Would like to mention Sneha, Anjali and Indra for the amazing hospitality and care that they had shown towards all the residents and making sure our stay was really wonderful"
"Great hotel. I stay here every time I'm in Kolkata. The rooms are clean, the gym and spa are good, and the restaurant is excellent. The property itself is large and isolated from road noise on the whole. You should eat at La Cucina if you get a chance. "
"Had the most mouth watering, scrumptious meal at La Cuccina in Hyatt Regency, Calcutta. I was very well looked after right from the moment I walked in and was assisted by Abhishek who made every effort to ensure my dinner was just the way I liked it. He was extremely kind and courteous and made my experience very memorable! Special thanks to Abhishek and the entire team of La Cuccina. Looking forward to many more visits!"

In-room dining is in good hands under Simran Joshi. I had called the hotel on my way from the airport and I requested her to prep a snakc for me before ieven checked i n. And she obliged. I was so at ease because of the help and understanding I received from her and her staff.. I hope Hyatt recognizes her potential as an employee. Thank you

Thanks to the team of Hyatt Regency Kolkata, especially Subhashish, Abhishek and Rahul for gifting me a wonderful evening!!!"
"I wisited RCGC with my team for RDPL celebration , i loved the aloo tikki ragra chat from Hyatt food stall it was very delicious and specially thanks to Chef debjit , subhasis and abhishek for making my evening special ."
This was a visit to meet my old friend and the hotel staffs made it wonderful experience. The staffs were courteous and helpful. The only feedback I have is for the restaurant (WestSide Cafe) to improve their service. That day there was too much of crowd may be due to some function and staffs could have managed the crowd better instead of guests waiting for their orders for more than average of 15 mins from live counter. 
I often stay at this hotel and find it suitable in every way. The In-room dining service is wonderful and an employee named Ms. Simran is very good in suggesting good food choices and fulfilling the orders meticulously. Laundry service is also excellent. I am thankful to the entire Hyatt Kolkata team.
"Best experience and happy working with them .....  surojit 
Chakraborty   the floor was very supportive with us and was helping us through out the event whenever we required thank you so muchh !!!  Hoping to work again"
Mr Giti Rout in laundry services undoubtedly repeatedly provide excellent services . Goes out of his way for customer comfort and pleasant stay . Staff is nice and friendly and hotel location and room view are good . 
The quality and taste of the food is excellent in Hyatt Regency. Ms. Simran was extremely helpful in making the choices. She not only makes suggestions which complement the food but also as per the palate of the customer.
"Even though stayed here many times, my last stay was really memorable. Special mention for Mr.Rajesh, who was the duty manager. He made sure that each and every need was taken care of from check in till check out. Irrespective of multiple functions going around the hotel , he still managed to get time to personally call and check everything was taken care of. And I also would like to appreciate the effort of in-room dining in charge Ms.Simran Joshi who in every possible way made sure that the best food was served.Even though the hotel was fully packed due wedding ceremonies, still she managed to serve the food of my choice and that too on time ! People like Simran and Rajesh are definitely an asset for team Hyatt !
Highly recommendable property ! 🙌🏻 "
"We really satisfied with our program. We need to give special thanks to Manosij Das, Surajit Bhowmik, Nabab Sohel Ansari for their extra effort to make this program success. We really thankful to them."
"Excellent. was there for a corporate event at Hyatt Regency which was handled quite well by the team . specially mention to Surajit Bhowmick, Chef Souvik , Chef Kartik , Asif and the entire team for such an well handled event ."
Nawab Sohail Ansari best bar tender service was fentastic all in one hotel staff and browmik well managed everything last but not the least bar tender was best when ever he had given me cocktail. Thanks and good wishes for him.
I like the food.i like the behaviour of Rohini the most.we r fully satisfied.want to visit again with my family and friends.wish to come in special days of my life......❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.The ambience of the restaurant is awesome.
"By far the best Italian restaurant in Eastern India.
Staff Abhishek, Nawal, Rohini and Chef Dola Singh will pull all stops to make your experience here something to savour everytime you think of it.
The food is addictive... Standards have been maintained such that loyalists have been NEVER skipping a weekend for over ten years!
The Sunday brunch is iconic, and is a club of its own.
Authentic tastes and fine flavours.... Something most new gen eateries haven't got right yet."
"Check in process was superb. Good Proerty. 

Later in night, I had to struggle to get the extra bed setup. I guess shortage of staff ! It was really annoying to wait for almost an hour in late night when you desperately want to crash in the bed. Improvement area."
"we visited la cucina for the first time and it was a great night food were soo good in taste specially the tiramisu....kudos to the team Aritro,Abhishek,Rohini ,saurav and sneha were great at their service skills....we loved it..."
It was a lovely evening with my wife. I came here for the first time the the ambiance like awsome. The service was provided by everyone like awsome. Special thanks to Mr abhishek rohini aritra sourav sneha for their lovely service. Will recommend everyone. Please come here and enjoy the Tiramisu oh I just loved it
"It was a great dinner at la cucina....the ambience was so good and they have some good collection of wine in their....Their staff were excellent ...special Aritro,Abhishek, rohini,sourav and sneha really served us very well...thank you will visit again"
"Lovely dinner with friends. The Hyatt team has been great. The table setting was perfect. They attended to everyone. Perfect ambience. Wish them all the luck. Thanks to Aritro, Robin, Abhishek, Sourav and Sneha."
Everything has always been perfect. I have stayed in Hyatt many times and consistently the experience has always been good. Special mention for  Simran from inroom dining and Soumani From front desk who have always been really helpful and make the stay more pleasant 
"Amazing experience specially at cafe. The kind of service provided by Ankita was exemplary. 
Keep the spirit to server customer the way u r serving. I m really have to stay in the hotel. I would prefer to stay here time and again."
"Unlike any other bar around the city The Bar at Hyatt has its unique features, not so loud music, not so much of a crowd , a perfectly suited place for a person to enjoy their drinks 
I would like to mention Mr.Jit the bartender for his excellent service 
Followed by we had our dinner in waterside cafe , buffet spread is awesome, very delicious food , and print service provided by the staff over there, Specially Mitish, Indra, saikat sneha and deepraj"
"We have taken cocktails like breakfast martini🍹 from RCGC stall ...it was superb....food also very tasty ...the people like Abhishek,Rahul & Subhashis is really good ....thank u so much.......much appreciated.."
"Nice cozy place, away from all the crowd of the hotel, after a long time I have found a peaceful bar in the city 
Food quality is excellent as well as the drinks made by Mr.Jit 
His service was very quick 
Will surely visit with all of our friends"

"I recently visited Hyatt Regency Kolkata for brunch in Waterside Cafe. Firstly I called to make a reservation, the girl who took our reservation Ms. Priya she was so curtious and humble. When we went there she greeted us with so much warmth. She was brilliant with her work. My brunch went absolutely amazing just felt like I was at home. Thank you Priya would definitely visit again."

She is a Good asset for thr hotel"
Reception team was amazing.. always in time and superb in their service. Simran Thank you so much! Sam great service and hospitality. You guys rocked. Hope to come back soon for more days and thanks to the bell boys too.
We had a great time at the Pool Bar Hyatt. Mr. Shabbir assisted us with a wonderful dinner and made sure we had a good time! Brownie points for the ambience! It’s a perfect place for a winter evening!

"We visited to hyatt for the first time..its was a great day visiting this place 
The ambience was so welcoming....we had our dinner at waterside cafe .....the food was really good in taste....their was varity of choice in the menu and their staff were really good at suggestion specially Anjali and Bichitra was so professional and friendly and they makesure that every food was served on the table perfectly presented and hot..and the dessert was superb....This service will make me visit again"
"A fantastic hotel in terms of the service offered by exceptionally friendly staff. 
In terms of location proximity to the metro is a strong point-the hotel is located close to Salt Lake and Beliaghata is not far off. Close by is a shopping mall where you can spend a day.
The Netaji Indoor Stadium is just next door.

We were there for a month and had the opportunity to assess the hotel closely
Firstly some constructive feedback-parts of the hotel decor and furniture are dated and need of a refurb
This does not detract from the overall comfort that the rooms provide however and the bathrooms in particular are good with what I would describe as a really good wet room delivering an excellent showering experience which should be a much needed experience particularly if one is visiting in the summer
We were there is February and enjoyed hot showers everyday
The housekeeping staff stocked the bathrooms with shampoo and body wash gel and even provided dental kits when we needed this
The rooms were cleaned to a high standard and the linen was changed regularly
Special mention of Maninder,Manoj and Rehman who catered to our every request
The carpets and furniture could do with a refurb, but were comfortable enough and I didn’t miss my bed at all (I am quite fussy about this)
Breakfast is served in the morning and there is lots to choose from
We really relished the Indian breakfasts as we don’t regularly get this in the UK and I have to say that most of the food was delicious
The staff at breakfast were helpful courteous and very friendly and catered to our many requests
Special mention of Aman Pradyut Tanmoy and Ankita although all the staff were really hospitable
There are other dining experiences as well although we did not get the opportunity to dine in the other restaurants
The lobby staff were really helpful- Rajesh really helped us with a sticky situation in the next room- a newly married couple were rebelling way past midnight and he helped quiten then down and the problem did not recur
Bishal was very helpful as well
The reception staff gave us a touching farewell on the last day and this was even more special for us given that this month long visit to Kolkata was prompted by a medical emergency in the family
In short Hyatt provided us with a feeling that we were living with family and looked after us exactly with this feeling in mind
We have stayed in many fancy hotels in the world but have not come across such a wonderful bunch of people
Definitely will return
Ranjan Basu"
"After a very long time we visited the bar, use to be our place , I was very cherished that the place has not changed a bit same feeling we got 
Mr. Jit took good care of us starting from the drinks till the food , the service was very prompt 
Mr. Saikat also came to visit us nice to see him after a long time,
Will be visiting again soon"
Lunch at waterside cafe was amazing...there was so many options in buffet And each food tasted awesome.....after that credits goes to the cafe team specially mitesh who was too friendly with us he served me some fabulous mocktail named salty caramel espresso with was so good in taste...we will visit again
It was an great experience visiting Hyatt....Abhishek and Shabbir took care of us well with some delicious food....they made our evening so special worth remembering....whenever we visited here we felt like our own place...I would suggest everyone to visit here...
Kudos to the waterside team for making my birthday so special ..Hyatt regency kolkata is one of the best hotel in Kolkata to visit on special occasions they organise everything so beautifully...special mention to Saikat and mitesh who treat us so well ...The food quality and service was top notch....Thank you guys...a day to remember forever
"The Stay turned from Bad to good with the support of the staff, primarily Soumani. She was very helpful anytime I needed anything.  The first day the stay was pathetic as the A/C in the room was not working and the staff kept on insisting that it was error on our side in the way we were using the A/C. This was not the first time I was staying in a 5 star or not the first time I was using A/C. However the front end staff heard the concern and immediately changed the room next morning, and there was no other issues after that"
"I visited waterside cafe yesterday, anjali was a good buddie, shev was very  helpful and welcoming the ambience was really great. Loved it ❤️❤️, the experience was quite good, will recommend my friends"
In my recent stay at Hyatt Kolkata my experience has been amazing. The staff service is amazing. Special thanks to Simran and Chef Amandeep who made this stay more amazing by providing excellent quality of Service. I have been visiting the hotel since past one year and there is major improvement in food which is been cooked in buffet . I would recommend the hotel for anyone’s future stay.
"Thank you Simran for the wonderful hospitality. Food was very delicious and was made just as  what I had asked.
Excellent service and enjoyed the dinner alot.
Thank you once again will be surely visiting the hotel again."
"It’s was lovely  time I have spend here 
Aritro -he have served us in lovely way , every drink he made it was really refreshing.
Saikat- he is also arranged it so well .
Thanks so much for making. My day so special ❤️
Will visit again.."
"Went back to the Hyatt Kolkata after a long break. The staff at the Porch, front desk , housekeeping ( Mr Shoumyan) and in room dining ( Ms Simran Joshi) were very courteous. Food quality has improved. Great work ,keep it up!"
Chef dola Singh has been a wonderful chef...and he is very open to feedback one of the best chef in hyatt and we have seen his hospitality he is really good and the food is awesome in hyatt really recommend o fian and itian
"Far from home yet you don’t feel that you are not at home…special touch by the chef,the interaction with in room dining and the people who served hospitality was impeccable…special mention to Soumani and Rashmi for lovely Parathas…will see you soon…Thanks"
Had a pleasant stay at Hyatt Regency Kolkata. Good property with excellent service. Special call out to Mr. Rehman for taking care of my needs and going the extra mile to serve your customers. You indeed left a smile on my face.
"It was an excellent evening in Hyatt regency the setup was wonderful thanks for all this arrangement…Thanks to the hyatt team Mr. Kumar Shovan,Ershad Mullick,Saikat,Indra Ganguly,Aritro,Tanmoy and Sandipan …chef Amandeep and Uttam chef to make our evening more special….we would love to visit again…the food and service were really excellent . Kudos to team hyatt !!"
"I have been here a couple of times, and as always Hyatt lives up to the expectation. Along with having amazing rooms, the food is extremely scrumptious. Thanks to Simran, she was very kind at taking my food requests, willing to go out of her way, the food was delivered exactly how I liked it. 

Highly recommended place.

Thanks & Regards,
Shamoil."
Great IRD menu and food quality. Simrans assistance in suggesting the best items was much appreciated. Keep up the good work. The cheeze cake and chocolate pastry were the most enjoyed items. Cheers!!
"Had a wonderful outing with friends and our dogs! 

Aritro Das assisted us and he was outstanding! Very cheerful and attentive, even when he was handling multiple tables mostly on his own. 

Hyatt food is always good and it’s very nice that pets are allowed. 

The only two negatives this specific evening was 1. Not all food choices were available in the set menu. 2. The ambiance was not great. There were two other events going on in the same ground, three different music from each direction, all extremely loud. So it was very chaotic. We could barely hear each other speak."
"Stayed at Hyatt for a wedding. A beautiful hotel.  The GM and his team were amazing in all respects. The great attitude of the staff is something which is verbally absent in this part of India. The quality of food surpassed my expectations.  Banquet did was great which is quite difficult and seldom found even in the best of the hotels. 
The hotel does require a complete renovation of not only rooms but even public areas. If they can upkeep the hotel to international standards,  this hotel will stand out and give a run for its money to is larger competition. 

I congratulate the GM and management of the hotel for their endeavour to overcome the physical state of the hotel and still give a very satisfactory experience to their guests. 

I will love to recommend this hotel to entries"
"Well located in ( about 35 minutes from airport), very spacious hotel with ample facilities to include a tennis court, beautifully maintained garden by horticulture department around a stylish shaped swimming pool, surrounded by fountains. Location of Breakfast buffet and gym is awesome and faces the green. The lounge at 5th flor is class apart with a bird's eye view of the lavish hotel premises.

Cons: The rooms have a tinge of paint drops all over floor and walls as if uncleaned floor and walkway around the hotel within boundary of hotel if not taken care of.

Overall a nice experience for a short stay. "
One of the best time I've ever spend..foods are the best..food quality is good... One of the highly recommend restaurant..and obvio want to mention the behaviour of the staffs.. specially ms.priya who organised all things better way and her behaviour is so kind.. that thing made our dinner experience good. That was my second time I've visited with zero complaints.

Special mention to Surajit Bhowmik and Chef Debnath for the event .The mocktails were really refreshing . The asian counter , asparagus counter was really amazing.

"Ideally located in NewTown, this is nice hotel and one of my favourites.

The staff is very warm and welcoming. The rooms are well-equipped with all modern amenities.

The breakfast spread has improved considerably as compared to my previous visits. The food still needs to be worked upon. But thats basically with all Lemon Trees.

A special thanks to Tripti Sharma who goes out of her way to make our stay most comfortable and more than compensates for the short-comings.
A word of appreciation to the house-keeping staff Kabir who's always ready to help you."
The hotel was situated at very nice location and the room service is quite excellent here it’s my 5th stay and I still don’t get bored . Also Mr Kabir will always be there to look out for any needs. Ok

"Every staff member makes you comfortable. Even if you need any assistance they never say no ..., they extend all help with right inputs. COVID SAFETY IS 100%. whenever I am in Kolkata I stay at this place...
We Had a great time with family and friends . Amazing food , great service from staff. Wonderful ambience too.. and we do recommend Lemon Tree Kolkata. It was child friendly too ,beautiful outdoors to walk around.
They have been always attending to the guest requirement in time. Restaurant , breakfast quality and spread very good. Just because of few staff like Mr.Ranajit we got some relief and special attention. Wish all the good working staff to do well and continue to support the clients....."
"The food was excellent and the Service as well. Everything we ordered was fresh and
delicions. Hospitality & Responce is too good. Special application to Sajjad , Rohith and Pradipta. Keep up the good work and all the best."
"It was a very smooth stay , with great amenities,  well trained and helpful staff, great location on main road  just beside malls .. lots of covid related precautions are taken care... classy decorations... cafeteria has good food ... fully secure and safe environment.  Good for families with children also . Food well served in rooms if requested."
"Thank you very much for all good food , specially prepared jain. Good Suppprt given during stay. During local visit extends support given for arranging lunch. Rooms are quite specious and good city view."
"First of all you can say it's a 3 star hotel. Poor service and food quality. Property is totally understaffed.

ROOM: Rooms are okay. If we compare with price not up to the mark but rooms are clean and specious. We had booked for a king bed but they provide two separate single bed. After complaint front desk replied that's what they have at this moment and can't do anything. So I will rate them 3/5.

SERVICE: 1/5. Property is totally understaffed. A lot of unprofessional trainne are working there. For a small thing you have to wait a lit whether it is check in check out room service or food. There is no exception in this.

FOOD: 1/5. Don't trust me you guys can check their resturant's rating too in this matter. Worst type of experience. Extremely costly but tasteless food. Not just taste if you are really hungry I will say it's better to go outside and grab some food. We had to wait for 1 and a half our for out food and after this long time they delivered us wrong items. 

Good part is you can enjoy a good view of the city  from the room. 
Location is pretty good. Ecopark, axis Mall, biswa Bangla gate all this things are really close to the property.

Suggestions: If you really want to spare more than 5-6k for a stay don't choose this property. If you are getting this property for 3k per night then it's okay not more than that."
"We visited Citrus Cafe for birthday celebration of our son. It was a wonderful experience and had great time. Food was awesome with great taste. And special thanks to Mr.Sajjad, Mayukh and Pradipta for great hospitality."

I went to the restaurant with my family including my daughter this week. It was a nice experience. Food quality was great. Would like to mention specifically Mr Ranajit Biswas. He was really cooperative and very kind to cater our different food  for older people and for kids. Will like to visit again soon.
"We went for a family dinner in Lemon Tree kolkata and had a great time. Food was really good, very warming staff . We were greeted by Ranajit Biswas in the restaurant  Citrus  and he is really efficient and kind to cater all our different needs. I loved the buffet but my favourite was Fish Malbar curry. Will definitely visit again."
"Travelled on work. Appreciated the cleaniliness and hygiene standards, given the Covid situation. 
Not too far from the airpoert, so that was good too. uber and cabs can easily be got, and it has  couple of malls at a walking distance,
only breakfast was open during that time some months ago, and room service, so food wise it was a bit limited."
"It was a nice experience at Lemon Tree Premier Kolkata, smooth check in and well taken care of our group, special thanks to Mr.Abul ji sales person and front office manager Ms.Tripti Ji.

Perfect place for budget Friendly Event's and Group. Do Contact Us for Any Help in Booking of Event's/ Groups.

"I have stay almost 3-4 times always it is really nice..
But this time I was really upset with the staff behaviour at front desk she (Ms. Brotati) was not atall professional and polite or rather welcoming, she was very rude ,arogent from the time of check in as if we staying at the hotel for free and she is giving us some kind favours out of no where.
This is seriously not expected from a well organised hotel and this is not what a Customer pays for....?? 
Other than that it is always nice to stay here food is amazing..."
"Very Nice Service
Food was excellent
Nice location
Good Ambience
Hygiene well maintained
Rooms well maintained
All covid rules being followed
Management extremely co-operative
Banquet hall was also very nice"
"My stay was too comfortable and way better than expected. When I entered, I was greeted by someone called Ms. Bratati from reception, she was really sweet, polite and also very cooperative. She made my checkin so easy. I didn't have to wait for too long for that. 
Then coming into the room, it was quite spacious including all the things you need for a luxurious stay, maintaining all the safety and hygiene measurements. I visited when Covid19 was still on, so I was a little septic, but inside the hotels everything was properly clean and tidy, which I absolutely liked. One thing I liked the best was the night view of the city through the gigantic window, from the 9th floor.
And otherwise I loved the stay all together. Gonna come again for sure. I'll recommend this hotel to others as well. 
Good wishes to LTPK."
"We visited the restaurant today i.e. on 7.11.2021 for lunch.
Food served was Orson. 
Chef Mr. Subhankar had given personal attention to make the dishes testy. Each item was with unique fragrance and taste. We all enjoyed the Chinese dishes to the fullest. This has become our favorite enjoyable place. 
Hoping that the regular  Chinese Restaurant will open soon to enjoy more dishes of Mr. Subhankar, the professional Chef of Lemon Tree, New Town, Kolkata. 

With all Good Wishes, 

Subrata Mishra"
"We had Asian food at the hotel and Chef Subhankar ensured that it was heavenly.

Food was at its best and the Taste was out of the world.

It is the special care of Chef Subhankar and his love poured into the food which makes me flock this place again and again. 

Lets hope RON opens soon for an even amazing experience."
"Very homely atmosphere and all the employees are so helpful....food quality and rooms are excellent 👌

"On 17th october I stayed with my family and frnds at lemon tree. It was an outstanding experience I am really obliged by the Hospitality of all the staffs. With special mention to Mr Deepak Chetri he is so cordial and gentleman. The hotel and it's staff did a commendable job in trying to make us feel comfortable during our stay there. 
Please keep up the good work"
The staff are amazing  very humble  people helpful and understanding. They are providing  very good service  and  my Special thanks to staff Miss Arina and Mr Ranajit. Love to comeback soon and meet you guys agin.
"Pros

Good room 
Excellent location
Good city view
Good furniture
Pool facilities

Cons

Very late responding front desk. No one looked happy
Average food. Taste is good. Not too flashy
Washrooms smell a bit bad maybe because they use recycled water
House keeping staff is not proactive"
"Hello, 

I have visited lemon tree 3-4 times. My recent visit was  on 27th sept, I stayed in room no. 1001. The view from that room was amazing! I would deeply like to thank Mr. Ghosh for upgrading my room from deluxe to executive room. He has been really kind. 

Nextly, I would love to thank Allpriya (i hope her spelling is correct) . The toilet accessories like Towel, Hand towel, Handwash, Moisturizer, Shower Cap were missing. So again and again I had to tell her, and she cooperated and got me everything. She took 3 rounds to get me everything because I reminded her of something or the other whatever came in my notice. She was a sweet girl, devoted to work. She definitely deserves promotion! 

Lastly, I would like to thank Mayup from In Room Dining, who offered me amazing manchow soup (which I ordered twice xD) and took feedback every time after I finished having it. 
He also offered a complimentary cold coffee to compensate as the manchow soup quantity was less according to me. The cold coffee was amazing and of good quantity! Thank you Mayup! 

Overall, thank you lemon tree for an amazing service. 

To Improve : The taxes are somewhat on the higher end. They charged 175rs excluding taxes just for a sprite can. Also, they include service charge in everything including food and room.  
My bill for 2 Manchow soup and 1 sprite can was 580rs approx including taxes. 
Whereas in the menu it's written Manchow soup for Rs 135/139rs (around)."
"Amazing experience with great hospitality and great staff behaviour specially Sunanda, Riya was really great in hospitality we enjoyed our stay.We are looking forward for our next stay in amaya in future."
"Room was  very nicely kept. No complaints on that.But  food needs drastic improvement. May be this is due to post pandemic effects as there are very few eating out. Hope they will come up with good food soon.
Those who wish to stay in New Town it is good choice. "
It was a very pleasant hotel stay. Specifically the F&B services and cleanliness of the hotel amazing. A very very special thanks to Mr. Mayukh. He is such a humble personality. The food was served to me was extremely fresh and tasty. Thank you for the excellent service.
"I have been a sort of regular customer of Lemon Tree Premier, New Town for quite a long time now and it all started during the pandemic. I was searching for hotels during the lockdown period as I had some family medical emergency for which I had to travel to Kolkata. Lemon Tree Premier not only helped me during that time but has been really wonderful throughout my stays. They have been quite hospitable and shown great care for my ailing family member. Just to give a shout-out to Faiz who has been wonderful in helping us in all our stays and sorting out all the issues that we had faced. Thanks a ton to Lemon Tree for standing by my side when I needed the most and thanks a ton to Faiz who has been taking care of all our request with a smiling face."
"Stayed for 2 days at Lemon Tree premium newtown, Kolkata in Feb 2021 with my family. We spent a nice time. Due to covid restrictions we could not visit swimming pool, it was also winter though :)
We got discounted price from lemon tree site.
Lots of options were available at morning buffet.
Better to choose breakfast package, as ala-carte would be a pinch to pocket.
Room service and Overall stay was pretty good. My kid liked it a lot."
"Yesterday night we are going to dinner at lemontree hotel really amazing  food we are enjoying  a lot 

 Staf are free kind very good hospitality 
Too hard worker . Surely we will visit again

"It’s a wonderful  property with arial view from rooms . I would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the service and care I received from lemon tree kolkata new town during my stay on 14th august room no 201 . I had a wonderful stay . Mr. Faiz rehman at front office was so polite and full of patience and always willing to give you special attention on all your questions whatever you asked  .I want to extend my thanks to Mr Kaushal from housekeeping who was there in lessthan 2 minutes whenever you call at frontdesk for housekeeping. Also I want to thank Ms Bratati who ensure my check in and check out real quick . The food here is  awesome 5 star quality .    i ordered sandwich late night  and it was  in my room in minutes though i was planning to order from Zomato which was showing around 1hr to deliver  .It is good value for money . really very clean,tidy and quiet . Just 20 minutes ride is sealdah railway station . I would recommend all whenever you are coming to Kolkata just try this budget friendly hotel with awesome customer service ."
One of the best hotel of Kolkota.Faiz one the member of lemontree is reason behind which we always visit the property and the most humble person I have ever met .one should visit the property it is Kolkota  one of the best hotel
"The stay was awesome , room was hygienic, food prepared by Chef Rohit Hari was fantastic, we liked the service of Mr Sajjad from Citrus cafe and Mr Faiz from front office. Hope to stay there again soon."
"I would like to thank Mr TARIQUE & Mr NAKUL for providing me with such a clean and tidy room with all the amenities and eye catching towel art. What else a guest need apart from neat & clean room especially in today's scenario when everyone is going through a bad phase during this pandemic. I would also like to thank Mr PRIYOJIT and Mr SAJJAD from F&B team to help me out during my time in coffee shop. Also thanks to Mr SAYANTAN from FO team to provide me with nice room with such a lovely view to just sit & relax. Last but not the least a big thanks to Mr PRABHAT (EHK) for having such a lovely and trained professional. I am overwhelmed with there professionalism and hospitality which makes my stay and 1st anniversary a memorable one. 
CHEERS !!! & KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
We where overwhelmed with hospitality of the Citrus cafe Mr.Ranajith & Team . We felt really home . The food tasted so homely and healthy . Thanks for the team . Appreciate and hats off for your efforts .
"My experience at the hotel as an anniversary gift to my wife was a 5 star experience because of a nice well maintained room with excellent view, good interior, nice location near axis mall, good quality food in room service well priced and good portion size. Travelling after a long time after the pandemic was nothing short of mesmerizing. Even after the challenges the pandemic present to the hospitality sector I think they did an excellent job. Strongly recommended just for their nice attitude. They promptly responded to every single concern. Now for the scope of improvement they could do well to give a welcome drink even if it is a disposable tetra pack, it just sets a mood of the guests."
"I would like to thanks to all staff of Lemon Tree Premier, Kolkata. We enjoyed alot in hotel and food is also tasty. Ranajit Biswas made a best quality of food and room service is very good. Pool, gym and restaurant is also available due to covid guidelines we didn't enjoy in pool but we took pics and did excerse near pool and took a rest and felt the cold breez. Reception staff is very kind people. They help in providing cab, and other facilities what you want from there. View of lemon tree is very good for photography

Good hotel with nice housekeeping department . Overall a Good hotel experience. Food is average as well as the service but the rooms are quite comfortable and spacious for quick stays . Good experience.
Everything is up to the mark including housekeeping person kaushal ( he is very helpful ) however except food. Could have been more worthwhile if they would have maintained the standard which they did for initial days.
"This is in regards to by long term stay at Lemon tree

"Visited the hotel in April 2021 and had an amazing stay at Lemon Tree, New Town Kolkata. The services were amazing and they take all necessary precautions against Covid.

The food here is also very good"
"Had a pleasant stay at Lemon Tree Premier, Kolkata in the month of April, 2021. The hotel is located in New Town free from the mess and clutter of Central Kolkata.  The rooms are fresh and crisp as the property is relatively new. In room dining/In house restaurant menu is quite limited. Food quality is okayish. However, the F & B team are ever ready to address your concerns. Their efforts in keeping you happy is appreciable. The breakfast served in the morning is good but seems monotonous when you stay for a longer period. Rotation of breakfast menu/introduction of new items is very much needed.  The prices at which the hotel is available these days makes it incredible value for all that it offers. It is a very much recommendable property!!"
"I was stayed in lemon tree premier Kolkata it was new property I guess one year old they are maintained quit nice service was quick food was delicious and the staff here is too friendly and polite the name of staffs who helped me a lot Mr
. Shibu,Kaushal,jitu, and Pralhad who made my stay comfortable and remarkable.
 Room cleaning was tidy the took my preference fully filled thanks to team lemon tree. 
Keep your good work up thank you"
"Well accommodated hall for more than 200 guests. Classic decoration with innovative touch and in-house food catering service was awesome. My relatives, friends, family members everyone was so pleased with their assistance and service. Special thanks to Mr. Ranajit who managed everything very well."
"I had stayed at Lemontree Premiere Kolkata, as a Match official from AIFF for a period of 2 months, wherein we all were in Bio bubble and not allowed to go out anywhere. The stay was long enough for us to easily pass over, but the staff at Lemontree was amazing and they made our stay not only pleasant but also a  memorable one.Mentionable are some who stood out in their service and hospitality, Mr. Prahlad from Housekeeping had become like a fly member taking care of our day to day needs, and ensuring that our rooms were clean and tidy, alongwith Ayaanbhai and Tanmaydada. Food for such a long duration from a hotel would be a nightmare, but Mr. Pradipda and Shaayaanbhai from F&B were more like our personal cook, offering tasty and healthy food to us alongwith Mr Rahul and Mr Aamir. An organisation is not known only by its infrastructure and resources, but very importantly by its staff, and I would rate Lemontree 5/5 in this sector. A must visit for anyone visiting Kolkata..."
"This is a good hotel in low bedged in Kolkata. I was there around three months . It's a fantastic visit in my life forever. This hotel staffs are very nice. They are all times in their toes to serve you better. Thank you....

"I must mention that the Housekeeping team and F&B guys are very cooperative. Without any complaint Pralhad & his housekeeping team did an excellent job during our stay of 3 months, they always taking care of us, they always kept my room neat & clean, kept all required toiletries in an organized way, whenever there is any problem Pralhad took the initiative to call the maintenance guy to resolve my complaint. It was the same case with the F&B team; they too were very cooperative, especially Pradipta & Sayan from the F&B team took good care of us during the entire duration of our 3 months stay."
"It was my home for 2 months and did not feel like I was living in the hotel. Thanks to the excellent service and well groomed staff who made me feel at home. The food they service is fresh and tasty. Special mention to the housekeeping department who kept my room clean and the guys at the slounge who were always ready to serve the customers even during late hours. Overall, it was a great experience and in my opinion one of the best hotel in New Town area."
"The stay was really good and the staff here made it absolutely amazing getting us everything we wanted and made us feel like home. Specially Mr Pralhad, housekeeping department kept our rooms super clean and arranged us everything that we had asked for in time not giving us any reason to complain. A must try for all the people looking for places to stay near this area. Trust me you won't regret!"
"I was visited in lemon tree premier kolkata almost for month and I got services which I want.

"It's always a pleasure to visit east india room.. i would like to thank Pritam Das and team for their amazing service,, also i am in love with the entire view.. hope to visit again soon .. keep up the good work guys"
"One of the greatest aspect of this place warm Bengal-inspired hospitality along with the treatment of Ms. LOVELY Singh,Reshmi  Paul,Sanjay Prasad. Though I was alone still Mr. Sankhadeep Sen and Ms. Sanchayita accompanied me at The Swig with their extreamly nice behaviour.
A big thumbs up to Mr. Riki Mukherjee 🙏🏿 worth mentioning as well he was much more than a 'Superhost'. I'm overwhelmed with his amazing hospitality.
They together went above and beyond to assure I had Pleasant stay which I did. And a memorable one.The only sad part was leaving this place. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Worth coming back again ❤️"
"It was our third time eating at The East India Room, had a great time. Mr.Somath and his team knew their work really well and  fulfilled all our requirements very efficiently. Definitely visiting again 😊"
"Visited in Feb,22. Food quality and ambiance is good. Found issue with service and delivery time. Observed major deterioration in this area  after pandemic.
Cost is in the higher side, considering that people need to pay more at Raakutir, than any best class five star in Kolkata.

Considering price, service, food quality and old kolkata vibe, I would say this is not a place that good as value for money."
"While  me and my husband were looking for a 2 day trip to take a break from our exhausting schedule being both doctors i suddenly  found out About Rajkutir from tripadvisor..when we entered  the property  it gave us a feeling like we qre miles away from the rush of kolkata.though its almost placed in the heart of kolkata.the property  has been taken over by Taj.so there are some transitions  going on..But the staffs were so humble and polite they made our anniversary  special.i would like to mention few names from the front office  Lovely ,she is ""lovely"" in one word.Mr Somnath restaurant  manager who was always  there to provide us utmost comfort and fooding was of top most quality.Mr Sankhyadeep from the bar  managed an excellent  anniversary  dinner  for us.and last but not the least Mr Sujbhqjit who helped  with the full booking .
I would love to visit Raj kutir  again with my whole family."
"Excellent over all experience. Very nicely organised & executed events. Restaurant team & front desk is very attentive to guest needs & immediately respond. Few team members who excelled - Sanjay- F&B, Munshi & Swarnali from Restaurant,Natasha, Gautam Das & Lovely Singh....made all the difference to our stay. Thank you team Rajkutir."
"Exceptional hospitality at East India Room and equally good food. Had a gala time in celebrating my birthday along with friends and family. The food, especially Dungar Chicken was appreciated by the guests. Last but not least, thanking Mr. Shamim and Mr. Munshi for making the arrangements very smoothly."
"We went there for an dinner along with family friends, who were just back in India for vacation. The food and the ambience was great. More importantly the hospitality was great. Specially Samim Gazi and Sanjay Prasad was very helpful, in sharing the details about the concept. We dined at East India outlet and the ghee roast mutton is worth mentioning. Keep up the great work and Kudos to the entire team of Raj Kuthir."
"I am overwhelmed by the hospitality they offer, the property is very pleasing.  It was my sister's birthday and we wanted to enjoy some vintage bengali colonial aura kinda things. 

I really liked our host Munshi and Shamim. Both of them are too courteous. 

Do visit the place,  if you are looking for a good lunch or dinner experience. 

Their cafe, bar and restaurant, all are of premium quality

I appreciate  the efforts they have taken to remind us, our ""Rich Bengali Culture"" and the splendid efforts to preserve it."
I went there for a small family function of 20 people. We had a great time as the staffs were extremely helpful and cooperative. The food was of great quality and the overall experience was top notch.
"Food , ambience and service is superb

Loved every bit of our visit , extremely good hospitality, infact it is at it's best .

Crews are amazingly good and service is prompt . Food quality and quantity is sumptuous. Ambience is awesome."
"It was amazing experience at swig… went there for the first time and loved everything about the place…starting from ambience.. food quality.. service quality …. Courtesy… everything was outstanding…. A must visit for everyone…. 
We actually received Royal treatment… which we loved😊❤️
Special mention about Mr Sankhadeep who guided us excellently for both choice of drinks and food..

Looking forward to visit the place again"
"Beautiful ambience,  the music was really soothing. Food was too good. Even we got a mouth watering Ice-cream from chef!  Last but not the least,   the hospitality was excellence.  We enjoyed a lot, hope to visit there again."
"My friend Sanchayita suggested me  Raajkutir. I stayed 6 days there..Wanted a homely ambience,and I mush say I got what I wanted.it was our birthday. She made my day more special for me. A candle light dinner set up was there at the swig. Complementary cake was there.Suggested exactly what I would love from their menu. Took personal care of us as their family. And specially Mr Sanjay, who was so familiar to talk ,made our stay unforgettable. The special puja buffet was amazing. Mainly we were not bored like we were at other hotels, each and every staffs were approachable,and with friendly nature. Next time when we'll visit Kolkata,it will be Raajkutir only. Highly recommend"
"Had a great time celebrating my mother's birthday at Raajkutir!

The property's old-worldly charm is alluring and the rooms are beautifully maintained. We took a Premium room which was extremely spacious and the balcony overlooking the back garden was a quaint place to spend the morning in. From an accommodation standpoint, the only thing which was bothersome was that the property does not provide extra beds or even foldable cots, instead one must make do with a floor mattress - which we found to be quite uncomfortable.

We had all our meals at the East India Room whose food was par excellence. All their preparations were absolutely scrumptious! From the Chitpur Road Jali Kebab to the Chingri Maacher Malai Curry - I would definitely go back to have more. A special thank you to Shankhadeep (from the bar - the Swig) and Rehman (from the Loafers cafe) who ensured that our birthday celebrations were on point with cake, wine et al. 

Lastly, a huge shout out to Subhajit Jana who went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of and also kindly agreed to give us a tour of the floor.

All in all, if you wish to experience the Raajbari heritage of West Bengal - it does not get better than this place located in the heart of Kolkata."
"The food and ambience was good at the swing ...
 The staff ware very helpful and polite ... would love to go again ...              Mr. pritam was serving us and helped us with everything we need . A grate place to visit with family and friends.. only I dint like the locality ."
"We were staying there during the first 2 days of Durga Puja to avoid the crowds and traffic in the city. 
The checcking in process was extremely smooth and all the COVID protocols were strictly followed. Coming to the room, it was a spacious room beautifully done up in old Bengali style. The washroom has my heart, it’s a beautiful one with ample lights and an antique mirror.
However, after 2-3 hours the AC started leaking water and there was a puddle right in the middle of the room. The staff responded quite effectively and sent a technician to fix it who did quite a temporary job and assured that it would be fixed within the next hour. But, that wasn’t quite the case as water continue to leak again next day morning, when they sent an actual AC company technician to fix it, it took quite sometime but this time it was fixed for good.
All through the experience the staff were impeccably polite and offered us to change our room if required.
Overall staff behaviour is excellent, the breakfast buffet is limited but quite well made, the rooms are an experience altogether and the courtyard adjacent to the room was really well maintained and great for photography.
I would surely visit the property again."
"Don't know from where to start, it was really a great experience,  I stayed in the Rajababu Room , the rooms were awesome , the foods were delicious,  in room service and dining was also great , loved the service of Asish Chakraborty (IN ROOM DINING) , the structure and design of the property really makes you feel as if you are Raja/Rani entering your fort, a must visit place,  specially with your family. Loved the DJ during Puja 🤘 , will visit again in future"
"Absolutely delightful experience at Rajkutir.
The ambience and hospitality is outstanding. 
So is the food at East India Room as well as The Loft.
They have also helped me curating meals just the way I would prefer. 
Rajkutur offeres options for a,Day out or a,staycation.
But this place is to be experienced and sipped in like a good wine.
So do go with some time"
"Had a Business get together here with office colleagues. The dinner was arranged in swig bar due to rain and I would rate it as a 5 Star experience in all aspect. Special mention to Somnath who had took care of every minute detail and made our get together Special. 

Ambience - No words to describe . The set up was awesome. 

Food - The taste was awesome right from Starter to Main course

Staff- Each and every staff was on top to make our evening special. I would sincerely appreciate their effort. 

Would love to visit this place again. I would strongly recommend this place to all. 

Again Special Thanks to Somnath and his entire team for making the evening a momorable one. "
"RaajKuthir, is properly maintained with amazing decor and ambience giving it a Royal touch to the place also it’s a picturesque place to spend with your family, friends, business meets or even solo or couples. 
Amazing fooding experience too. 
Overall a must visit place."
"The property was beautiful with spacious premium rooms along with superb hospitality. 
The Swig and it’s cocktails stirred by Shankadeep was one of the finest in the city. Loafers cafe and the East India Restaurant all served fantastic food. Highly recommend this place."
"Who doesn't want a splash of heritage amidst the urban jungle. Swabhumi Rajkutir provides the mundane urban life with a fantastic show of our heritage with cool architecture, beautiful ambience and warm hospitality. I had visited the place last month for an event amd completely fell in love with it. The hotel consists of banquet halls where various events can be held, there are several cafes and restaurants for a delicious meal and the venue is perfect for a wedding with their picturesque surroundings. 
All in all the place is a great option to spend a lovely time with one's friends and family."
"This place used to be my play area when I was a kid after years if not a decade later  I returned to be mesmerized and shocked by the way it has been changed. Went there for living my childhood again but had no idea it changed like this so yes we ( me and my fiancé ) made a plan to stay there. Kudos to the whole team who took care of us food was mouth watering, Ambience was superb. I sure want to give  big shout to the the front desk persons each and everyone of them were just wow Aritra, Sraban , Subhajit and lovely were the ones to help us with everything. Aritra being the one taking for a tour of the hotel and telling the whole story to us and letting us know what kind of legacy we will be hugging at the time of our stay. Everything from outside is having a vintage touch but opening the door of the rooms we met the future, truly what a transition and what a explaination by him and story telling in short time while taking us to the room we got to know 90% of the story. In east India Room kudos to aman, Manoj , Munshi for there service they were the sweetest people i met even in rush handeling everything with ease but yes I found delay in serrvice at In room Dining but its ok the property is huge and can be seen they are having a huge shortage in staff. will surely comeback to enjoy the pool and spa which we could not able to do."
"'Raajkutir' the name itself is enough to describe the place. Royal banquet with amazing ambience which is simply beyond words. The place has a touch of bengal ethnic royalty and mesmerizing interior . 
The hospitality was so amazing and the food they serves are really premium quality. Perfect for photoshoot, events, corporate parties, and so on."
"This place is a royal boutique hotel of Kolkata and one of my favourite.The ambience was so attractive.The management system,staffs' behaviour were also very well maintained.We had a set buffet menu during our program and the quality of food was good.Velvet lounge was very well maintained and decorated.It was a great experience for me and definitely will try to visit this place again."
"You entered the gate-saw the royal chariot and there you are in the lap of luxury and royalty.
""Live life,king size ""_they mean it!
The bricks, the wall, the decor tells you story of Colonial time during British Raj.
The dining experience was impeccable. 
We had our very own customized Indian set menu and regarding the taste i have 2 words. Absolutely delicious!
This is my 3 rd visit.Ive been there to attend weddings before, this place was always at its best.
Kudos!"
This place heralds the 19th century Zamindari era of Bengal with its flawless scenary crafted to perfection. It is located at Swabhumi. This is the best place to relax  on weekends when one toils the whole week with work pressure.
"It was last sunday, I visited this place for the first time, it was an official Anniversary Meet.
The theme of the meet remained to be ethnic this place was our first choice.
Under the blue of the Sky, in the womb of ether, the hands that has painted it white.
Honouring the cultural impact of the 19 th century Zamindari era of Bengal. The meticulous designs and the magnificent details make this place lavishly exotic.
The marvellous decor would Definitely add to your insta frame. Each & Every Corner stated the untold stories of 19th Century Zamindari 'Babu' Culture.
Coming to their food & hospitality it was more than great. We ordered our own customized Indian cuisines, that was served with much care and love. The menu was extensive.
Pandemic Safety Protocols were extremely strict
according to WHO's complaince.
They overall experience was just too good.This place is great for family, friends or official meets.
"
"The place was marvelously beautiful. The best place for weddings , events and shoots. I visited there for our food group events. Loved their services. Food was decent too. There's arranging the services really well"
"This is located at one of the finest location at Swabhumi. The entire area is beautifully designed. Each corner has the special touch of the royal genre. The chic decor is worth of celebration!

Highly satisfied👌"
"One of the best venue to host any occasion! Terrific atmosphere, hospitality, decor, and most importantly food is signature and top notched. The service was very good and the staff was very courteous. Will love to visit here again and again ..."
This was my first visit to Rajkutir and I was just amazed by the beauty of the place and the warm hospitality. The place is easy to locate and it took me a 20minutes drive from Ruby More. The food at velvet lounge was lipsmacking. They are following Sanitation protocols religiously. Certainly a great experience.
"Just wow! Doesn't matter you are travelling to Kolkata or you are from Kolkata. It's a must check in destination.
Paid a visit on 10th Aug as to celebrate my Son's birthday.
All I can say- the team made it memorable one'.
Special thanks to : Mr Sharwan, Mr Munsi & Mr Samim.
Thanks you guys for your warm hospitality.
See you soon!! "
It is a very nice and peaceful place. Employees out there are very much friendly. It is the best place to celebrate any occassion. Food here is also very nice. It is definitely not a 1 time visit. I loved this place.
"Well, I don't know where to begin. It's a place where I would like time to loop for an everlasting experience. It's peaceful, serene, neat, clean, and even though it's a make belief history, it still takes you to another parallel universe. This is my 1st stay at Raaj Kutir. The premium room are amazing. I stayed in ""Mejda"" (love the nomenclature of the rooms). Fantastic food, fantastic team, fantastic place.
I would recommend you to meet the amazing people at East India Room: Manoj, Munshi and Samim. The fabulous bartenders at The Swig: Sankhadeep & Subhendu. The very helpful and caring housekeeper Shubham (He is God sent) and the certainly the Front Desk Team, Subhajit, Aritra and Lovely (Front Office Manager).
Great job formed by Ambuja Neotia Hospitality!"
"This was my  2nd  visit and thoroughly enjoyed it,  D main thing  i love  about  this place  is its extremely courtiers staff, Specially  d dining  staff not only they cook  delicious  delicacy  for u but serve  u in a soulful  manner. DHRUVA  of East India  dining  room  is a true asset. And dishes  like  Mocha nakelpaturi,sorshey bhapa chingdi, red velvet cheese  cake  r outstanding ."
"The Swig, in Swabhumi, flaunts an ethereal ambience. The service, food, environment- everything was just outstanding! Our server, Mr. Abhisekh was just superb! He was very considerate and looked after our needs with excellence!

"I visited to this property with my friends. Amazing property with beautiful ambience. 
It was regards to room query. 
Aritra and Sraban was very helpful to me. Room was showed by aritra to me,Premium room is just Wow with all the Facilities. 
They make sure providing with Mask and sanitizers as it's very much essential this days for safety protocol. 

Please do visit you will love it. 😍"
"My sister's wedding was conducted at Raas Manch, and the service the extraordinarily satisfying. The food was mouth-watering and lavish. The overall look and feel of the venue is completely royal. The decor of the room is also very stunning and regal. If you come to Kolkata, it is a must-go-to place. The ambiance and cleanliness of the venue are definitely admirable.

The behavior of people in management is outstanding. The kind and humble quality of staff at the venue makes it the best place in Kolkata to conduct big events.  The budget rates that it has to offer are pretty reasonable with an exceptional quality of service."
Its very beautiful place. We celebrate our cake cutting ceremony. Food and beverage was too good. Specially subhendu who was very nice person. behaviour was too good and polite. His beverage and food suggestions was awesome. And mocktail was very refreshing.  I loved that place we will definitely visit soon.Thank you subhendu to creat a memorable moment at swig.

On June 30th, we were at The East India Room for lunch on occasion of our anniversary with a couple of close family friend couples. 
My wife is a Neotia employee, we hv bn here quite a few times earlier & honestly feel that this place both on count of ambience & palette will be right up there with the best the city has to offer.
We naturally chose this to be our luncheon place for the special day, got in touch with Bar Manager Somnath to make our special day memorable for us & our guests.
Somnath & his team left no stone unturned to do so. Right from calling us & wishing us on the day, to a welcome drink, to keeping the table ready with perfect fine dining decor to facilitation of some dedicated waitors, Somnath was on the money with his stewardship. 
Since, we have tasted most of their menu we had a fair idea of what was to come in our preset ala carte. The jali kebab, the crab starter, the lobster thermidor was all on expected lines of exquisite experience to savour. 
The real differentiator, however lay with what we ended our main course. Illish, was still not in the seasonal menu, but Somnath knowing my wife swears by them arranged for a 1.6 kg delectable virgin illish only for us. Chef Swarup prepared the customized near perfect tael jhol for us. 
These guys at Rajkutir, know how to really make you & yours feel spl. There was delicious fusion desserts & some photo ops for keeps to wrap it up. The taste lingered on thru the day but the memories wld for months.
The place is premium but then the choosy do now hv with Rajkutir the best to choose from the many better ones of our fabled food  city.

"Best place to stay at, wonderful property with lovely people to take care of stayed for few nights and we felt like being at home. Aritra and Subhajit were very polite and nice even after check out we we hanging around in the lobby then also they were coming around turn wise to ask if like to drink or have something. We are definitely coming back again and staying here. Even their manager were so nice never felt that they are serving our stay just felt our friends. Must stay place in Kolkata."
"First and foremost, Raajkutir is my most favourite dining destination in Kolkata. It has that immense serenity which really calms my week's stress! Coming to my experience at The Swig in Raajkutir, it was my first attempt at this bar outlet.
Ambience: Mix of grandeur and class
Staff: The bartender, Mr. Sankhadeep is an expert at his bartending skills and also had can hold a non invasive conversation with the guests. He adds a personal touch by interacting with the guests ensuring that the feedback is well received and implemented.
Food & Beverage: Just one word, ""Impeccable""
Overall: A perfect 5 star experience, which I don't get even at the so called 5 star hotels in Kolkata.

With limited staffing due to the pandemic norms on a weekend, I did not find a single flaw with the service!

Kudos!"
It has been a great gateway. With great food and brilliant hospitality. Special thanks to Aritra to make it possible and getting us the desired room with a great view. This place is very much unknown to people. Its been unknown to us that Kolkata had such a mesmerizing property.
It is our third visit and yes we are always mesmerized with its beauty. Went to celebrate dads birthday. Mouth watering delicacies was served special thanks to Mr. Samim and team make it possible and Mr. Aritra who has taken care of our every visit. One will never feel crunched up in a match box it is so wide open to roam and click pictures. Must visit inside the city but feels like out of the city.
"I had ordered a birthday cake for my sister.
The cake was amazing and freshly baked. It was a kiwi and mango flavoured cake with a tinge of pistachio and fresh cream. The flavor was extremely good and got an additional discount as well. Staff was amicable and had an amazing experience."
"Had a wonderful time. The staff were lovely room comfy highly recommend.Ambience of this place is no doubt marvelous.The food was always fantastic and no matter what I ordered always delighted with my meal! Servers were also great and always efficient, happy and polite,cozy restaurant has left the best impressions! Overall love this place and will continue to visit. Special thanks to subhajit Jana.We went to the hotel 2nd time for this person.Hotel with a unique view.it's was soo good experience with RAAJKUTIR."
"First of all thanks Raajkutir for this awesome experience ❤️stayed there for my business trip, but fallen in love with the property specially with the huge courtyard, never felt that what to do or what can be done the ambience and the atmosphere just melted like wwwooowww, the experience got more when I asked for a cab as I need to attend the flight to Bhubaneswar, special mention to Sraban for booking the cab at early morning, as I was not able to get any, and would like to mention about the Room service as well Aman helped me over the night as he was the guy who delivered the food whenever I required, thanks to Raajkutir once again,l will visit every time when I need to come in Kolkata.

"
"In this covid and tantrum of lockdown it is time to go out and chil. This place a very calm quite and away from traffic and mob sound. Having place to sit no need to stay locked up in the room, can room around inside this huge property. People are very kind and helpful Aritra and Lovely from reception helped us with everything. Food is just awesome. Rooms are clean and well mentioned. Must place for a gateway."
"Awesome property to spent your quality time, the ambience I liked the more even my friends are also stunned after seeing the property, the rooms are very nice and we'll maintained, thanks to Sraban for the lovely showround, special mention of #Swig bar just nailed it, people's are very friendly and always ready to help you even the security guards are also very well trained the guy from patio helped me a lot.

#best wishes to Raajkutir, will visit very soon for a family trip as well."
Fabulous experience with Food and service. It is an amazing experience with joy# love # yummy food # great service #great experience ## nostalgic ambience #ighly recommend. Thank you team EASTINDIA ROOM and RAAJKUTIR.
"What a fabulous time at East India Room.
It's USP on its  authenticity in food  but this quite impossible  without replacing the man Samim. who is  Viceroy of  EIR. Our interaction was just for a meal time but being a  manager he is a  gentle man with great sense humour . He carried Guest anticipation characteristics beyond the limits and he ensured amongst team with same spirit for guest service.  Me and my beloved wife loved the mouth watering dishes and  overwhelmed with elegant service. 
Looking forward to see you on our next transit to Kolkata. Stay safe.
"
I bought a Grand truffle Cake at Raajkutir. i have to mention it was out of the world. I have not tasted such a wonderful cake for a long time. melts in the mouth. You can feel that the best ingredients have gone in to make the cake so sublime. lots of thanks to chef Sumanta for suggesting this cake. I am sure he and his team will make things better only !
"Amidst the gloomy times and intermittent lockdowns, as rules were relaxed for dining at restaurants between 5-8 pm, we made our foray to the East India Room at Raajkutir. Delectable cuisines and effervescent service cheered us. All possible covid protocols were put in place. And we spent a lovely evening after a long time."
"While in lockdown it becomes difficult to make Birthdays special.

I was craving East India Room’s Mutton Biryani, Double Ghee Roast Mutton and Mutton Shai Korma. I got in-touch  with Gazi Samim from Raajkuthir and he left no stone unturned to help me out with placing the order, and ensuring it was as good as when I last ate there.  The team also took a special effort to put the cutest tags on the food bags wishing me for my birthday, which made me feel so so special! 

Post lunch and till date, my family and I can’t stop raving about the delicious food. My Birthday lunch was AMAZING and I’m already counting days till I can indulge again. 

Thank you East India Room and a BIG Thank you to Gazi Samim for making this happen! 🙂

P.S.: I don’t have pictures, because the food was that kind of tasty, where everyone was so tempted to eat once the containers are opened, and realised we’ve  not taken any pictures once the meal was over. 😄"
"We, a family of four, stayed here to celebrate my sister's birthday. From check in till check out we were treated very well, the people working here are professional, accommodative and gives you a vibe of sincerity. We spent our time by eating at East India Restaurant. Their food is traditional and authentic in taste. Spend some good time in Loafers cafe, their bakery is quite delicious and leisured around the property and the swimming pool. 
We were offered  breakfast, no question on their quality of food however, the variety is minimum. Overall I have loved my stay, we were offered late check out which was a nice gesture from the property manager. I especially thank Aritra Malakar, Sraban Chakraborty, Syed Rizwan and Shubham who has really ensured our pleasant stay and always served us with a smile."
"A very nice hotel in Kolkata with old Bengali style spacious rooms, the swimming pool view is very nice. Hotel staffs are very well behaved and helpful.
Mr. Aritra Malakar, Mr. Syed Rizwan & Mr. Shrabon Chakraborty made our stay painless. Definitely recommend for couples or friends who want to stay private but looking to have good time during these trying times. "
"Fantastic ambience and amazing food. Price is lil high but I appreciate it as that will help in keeping the crowd nische and helps in maintain the royalness of the property. Special thanks to Shankhadip, he is all there to help you choose your drink and also give u a complete knowledge of it"
"A surreal experience was to stay at Raajkutir boutique hotel. It felt like a hidden oasis in the original texture of ""Hustle and bustle"" of kolkata. A true union of antiquity & modernity. If one is artistically inclined, the place will usher him/her into a timeless journey of overflowing art & creativity. Its a mirror reflection of the historic Bengal and its sear richness of culture, art & intellectualism. The entire staff of the facility is thoroughly professional and charming. I would like to thank everyone from the resturant to the bar and the office staff for looking after me.

And would like to acknowledge my appreciation to the group of owners to create such a dreamy place.

Best wishes to everyone looking after the facility.

Regards
Prateek"
"Been here twice and man this is a place to stay. First time we stayed and the ambience we got was tremendous after which we changed to Ibiza but we were struck by these guys, we cancelled Ibiza and went back to them these time tool 6 rooms and yes it's a trip to remember. We all loved there hospitality and food. Food was awesomely tasty and mind blowing Prakash from housekeeping was awesome he served us with every request. Aritra he was the person who handled our reservation and he is a gem of a person and cherry on the top he mentioned that we all are like his family members which touched our hearts. This is a place to stay. NOT A PLACE A PALACE A HEAVEN"
"We stayed for 2 nights, and man its the best place to stay at. Like i didn't knew that there is a palace at kolkata to stay at at sucha a reasonable price. Food was awesome lipsmacking. Spacious rooms courteous staff. Special mention to Prakash from HK wwith all the request that we made he was promt at providing to us and everytime not only he the lady of housekeeping used to say if u require just give a call we will be here. Now the best one Aritra man a lovely person he is. My uncle got the reservation from him we took 6 rooms he made sure that we all stay close by and side by side rooms and such a welcoming person he is me and my sister liked his greetings and talking to us alot. All of my fanily members was so impressed by his gestures he even came all the way to the gate to drop us. And we felt so much like home they all are awesome."
"Yesterday I went to this beautiful place to celebrate my birthday with my family.The ambience was so peaceful & welcoming .The food was amazing & the staffs were very courteous & knowledgeable .I would like to thank Mr.Shankhadeep ,Mr.Abhishek & Mr.Somnath for their amazing hospitality.
Would love to visit again."
"Before actually stepping here, I had made n number of plans with one of my sisters and every time for something or the other it got deferred. Until I actually got to be a part of this beautiful place and more beautiful set of people, who had kept no stone unturned to make our stay and visit here, top notch; I realised that the first visit here was definitely meant to be special, SUPER SPECIAL.

@raajkutir -as the name suggests it ushered us to a traditional set up of Bengal, starting from the statue of the family Goddess(straight out of Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay’s novel)the bird cage, the hexagonal lanterns,old radio to a beautiful palanquin.
On being informed by one of the group members of Raajkutir, came to know that this 13 acre property used to be a wasteland and has been shaped into this beautiful place with quaint artefacts and aesthetics to act as a telescope which helps us to see the Bengal of the erstwhile years and more specifically the style and taste of The Zamindars during that era.

I had been in touch with few of the members of Raajkutir and finally Samim helped me curate a beautiful Bengali lunch at East India Room. The beautiful layout of that lunch is perhaps the best visual representation of Bengali food, that I have ever seen. The sheer happiness when we were greeted by a kulo which was nicely decorated with Diya, flowers and a bunch of people happily smiling as they knew we were yet to unfold more of their special arrangements.
Was in love with the sumptuous food and the commendable hospitality that was extended for us. Thankful to Samim and chef Shoumik.

Today when I went back to this place. I could actually glimpse the first time here. Though this time was meant for the Loafers Cafe.

Until my next visit here, taking back the visual love of the pink and white bougainvilleas and the white and mustard wall colour."
"I can't express my experience in words bcoz I m overwhelmed. I loved each and every arrangement and coordination from the time of my booking till my exit.
Thank you Raajkutir for making my engagement ceremony memorable"
"Hi

We attended the Valentine Day bash at Swig,Kolkata on 14th Feb '21.
alongwith 3 other couples- making us total of 8 people.

Though the ambience was nice and a live band was performing but we found the arrangements were not so good and they are not equipped to handle such a big gathering.
There were long queues at the  good counters - as it was buffet based..the starters were very limited and as they were all live counters we had to either stand in line or go without food.
There was no option despite paying the very high charges of 1299 pp without drinks..to get them on table.

There was a candle light put on our big table which was joined..when we requested them to bring one more candlelight, as it was not sufficient, they couldnt despite being told again- that was not  pleasing experience at all.
Even that candle went off after ceratin time and they couldnt lit it again...they should have adequate provisions if they are organizing such events/

Food options were very limited and not very tasty as compared to the high price we paid for it.

The management should provide better food and better service if they are charging and ensure proper arrangements.
There was no manager around also to whom we could reach across there.

Regards"
"Excellent Guest Service, High Quality Food, and a great environment that was appreciated by all our 70+ in house guests and remaining attending guests. 
Glad we hosted our wedding celebrations at Rajkutir, Swabhumi. 
The managers (Arnab), front desk (Aritra, Shantanu), and banquet (Ranajit) were very proactive and took the lead wrt coordination amongst guests to ensure seamless service, room allocation, check in and check out. 
Food was brilliant and highly appreciated by all the guests. Quite a few of the guests suggested that some of these dishes were the best they ever had in India. "
"Great ambience, classy decor, filmy candlelit table, picturesque circumstances, Superbly delicious food, tireless service of AMAN & MANOBI have made our anniversary night memorable. Strongly recommended"
"Greet room with great service, it's was soo good experience with RAAJKUTIR, room with very precise decoration, but not only that the room service was great and quick, my hole room was cleaned and they also , sanitize it before my coming indeed very few hotel took care of cleanliness and sterility and this hotel is one of them, great experience you all should give it a try guys."
"After a long time I have visited part of one of the social events. Love to be back at Raajkutir. The hotel is very well maintained as it was last time. The room on first floor was balcony with over looks beautiful outside view. The Check in was smooth, Ms.Lovely was very helpful and courteous too during my stay. The room was good ( this time I have stayed in other room). The rooms are well maintained and very cleaned. Good part during my stay on the 1st day I have asked for extras water bottle and next day the another person from house keeping was cleaning my room and kept extra water bottle after making my room, I was shocked with their internal communications to take care of their customer. The breakfast was good as well. During my stay I have meet Mr.Samim who was very attentive to take care my breakfast, the food was good. I have seen couple of new faces around me but the standard of services are top notch.
Most important part is - I have seen they do maintained good protocols for registration documentation and Sanitizing  which post this pandemic many hotels are not maintaining.
In one line - must visit and we'll secure hotel Raajkutir must visit.
Thanks team, see you other time."
"We had booked 7 rooms for a wedding. The hotel premises is a well maintained property, however, the rooms are not. The beds are the most uncomfortable ones I have ever slept on. To add to this discomfort, the pillows were as hard as stone. No pillow menu was available. The water pressure in the bathroom was extremely low. The rooms lacked proper lighting. All yellow dim lights were so uncomfortable. Not at all a 5 star standard property. The reviews are totally exaggerated. Wonder why no one has given an honest review regarding the beds and pillows. The safe was also not working in 3 rooms. We didn't have so much time to call the technician and get it repaired, so din't use it.
There was dust everywhere on the side tables, the coffee table, the chair. The floors were also not mopped properly before check in. I doubt there was no sanitization done. 
We got the room cleaned only on one day and the entire garbage bag was left outside our room 102 for 2 hours. Ultimately, I had to personally call the house keeping staff and get it removed. Horrible experience with the rooms.
On the good note, the food was tasty with decent options but not at par with 5 star rated as they call it. We had buffet breakfast and lunch. The service is good, staff are friendly and well disciplined. Staff are quite helpful though. 
I gave 2 stars only for the courteous behaviour of the staff or else it's just a one star for the maintenance.
"
"Went for lunch at the East India restaurant. The decor was subtle and gave the feel of a zamindari house, from the moment you walk in. The menu is well thought out. Lot of old zamindar house kitchen treasures have been included,like the jaali kabab, pantheras, keema Baidi parotta(old moglai parotta).dungar chicken, Dacca morog polao, dakbungalow chicken.. each and every dish was, well, cooked to perfection. Staffs were well trained and Manobi and Dhrubo, explained the dishes very well, which really helps, when you are spoilt for choices.

Finally, my advice would be, please take time to enjoy the dishes. These dishes have travelled through time to be presented on your plate. So be passionate in savouring them and let your mouth experience the burst of flavours one single morsel at a time."
"What a waste year 2020 was and RajKuteer Wasted my 31st Dec 2020 night too.. 

Like “S” is missing from “S”wabhumi in pics below, same way , “S”mile was missing from the face of RajKuteer staff. 
They “S”crewed our NYE totally.. arrangements were “S”habby. They couldn’t “S”tand up to their commitments. 
Won’t recommend anyone to visit and waist your time / energy and money in this place as they have mastered for aweful experience.."
"Nice is an understatement. To be honest, I was a bit sceptical in the beginning since the restaurant is not inherently an old quaint zamindar mansion like other heritage resorts around Kolkata. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the attention to detail Rajkuthir has tried bringing in to the ambience of this new boutique hotel and restaurant. 
Coming to the food, we were beautifully swayed away into the nostalgia of Bengali Culinary heritage along with the influence of European culture. One must admire the Dhaka morog pulao in there."
We went to Rajkutir right after our marriage. The highlight of our visit was the candle light dinner arranged by the staff. The food was delicious and the quantity was more than enough. The service by Manobi Rakshit and chef Swarnendu was praiseworthy in particular. We will definitely recommend Rajkutir especially for couples who wish to spend some memorable time together.
"Sankhyadeep’s service at the bar was perfect, he knew the cocktails very well. The hotel’s overall service was good. Each and every precaution with respect to Covid was taken care of. I had good time."
"A few days ago i happened to attend a wedding at raajkutir. It was truly an amazing experience. The breakfast at the East India Room was heavenly. I am hoping to visit again specially of the beautiful courtyard. I would like to mention a few people who made my experience more delightful. Daniel in housekeeping was a really great. Your reception staff are also exemplary, lovely and sraban were really helpful. They are always with a warm and a friendly smile. Over all it was an amazing experience. I would love to visit again."
"Excellent surroundings, a Royal like experience however buffet options are limited...Special attraction all the sea foods barbeque like prawn, squid, salmon, Bombay duck, Pomfret etc
Cons: No mutton/chinese items."
"Pros: Awesome grand structure, absolutely spic n span & very spacious! Very courteous and helpful staff & service people! Very picturesque setting that one can spend time in leisure & be able to avoid the crowd & be safe during this corona pandemic! The vintage ambience is absolutely lovely. The cake shop & bar adds to the options apart from the East India Room restaurant.

Cons: Food & beverage quality is just average! Although the price is at par with any 5 star facility, the food leave much to be desired. Lets start with the beverages, We ordered some mocktails which were lacking in flavour, extremely sour & needed addition of sugar syrup repeatedly.

For starters we tried a lotus stem kabab, & for all we know it could have been any veg kabab which was slightly on the too salty side.
The fish & chips were very oily & the batter coated fish had loads of oil as you cut through it.
The chicken stroganoff was not bad, but nothing extraordinary. The chicken Pulao was nice & aromatic.
As mentioned earlier, the food was just about ok nothing great & surely did not match the ambience of the place.
So a must visit for the ambience, but do not visit for the food or you would be disappointed.
But service was extraordinary & we enjoyed everything else."
"It was amazing to spending our precious time on the eve of our 3rd anniversary at Raajkutir.  The ambiance is just something more then Royal. Great presentation of aesthetic in interior and exterior part. Restuarant staff's are master in sence of hospitality. Our experience is really really great and for that evening we felt extremely special.  Thank you team . 

Will suggest everyone to give it a try.
Aman and Manoj thank you both of you for making us felt really really special. 
Awesome staycation option in the town.

One suggestion: we tried Barbeque dinner buffet in East India room,so would request the managers to include some more specialities in the main course as well. Otherwise everything else is just perfect.  Thanks!"
The place gives a surreal vibe. Antique and within the city spread across acres. Very sanitary. Great staff behaviour and care. Food is exquisite. A true experience. Good rooms as well. Loved it. Must visit for a great experience within the city
"It was my third visit to this amazing place and as always, it has been an amazing experience. The newly opened barbeque night made it all the more enjoyable. The warm and friendly staff made us all feel at home. Special mention of Aritra who made all the necessary arrangements even on last-moment notice. Also, Sanjay welcomed us back with so much warmth and made sure that our meal department was superbly handled :D Looking forward to visiting again soon."
Stay at Rajkutir is an experience worth sharing. Very much within Kolkata still it provides you with serene and tranquil ambience. Gives you the feel of grandeur of kingly architectural beauty with all modern amenities. Staffs were all courteous and cooperative. Special mention of Shraban Chakraborty the front desk executive is compelling as he had been the one window solution for anything and everything.
"A fabulous place! Loved my time! Would be visiting more often! Manoj Manna was an absolute delight and he took care of everything with regards to the hygiene, food description and suggestions, about the place. It's a must visit and also a very quaint place to take a staycation!"
"Lipsmacking aromatic bengali dishes with amazing desserts to end the meal is a die hard reason to love the place. Apart from food hospitality and safety measures are best.
A happy visit for us, will definitely visit again."
It was an excellent evening spent in East India Room. Special thanks to Manoj. He was very courteous and informative related to the dishes served at this restaurant. The restaurant is following high standard of hygiene. The food was excellent and very fresh. 
"I was searching for a place close by where I can visit with my parents. Obviously with the pandemic, my anxiety hit the roof as far as safety was concerned. But the team at Raaj Kutir took care of everything, especially Aritra Malakar from the reservation desk.
.
Hourly fumigation of the property, no checkin post check out from a room for 72 hours, contactless check in, sanitisation of car and luggage at entrance, lip smacking food, huge open spaces, and loads of laughter with my parents is all that I remember. The staff at the property are so so polite and family like. They cater to all your requests. The complimentary breakfasts are freshly made as per order, which really stands out, unlike other properties where they serve you in buffet. 
.
Prices are a little premium but so so worth it if you are someone like me travelling with old parents. Thank you @raajkutir for putting all my concerns to rest🖤🤍
..
It totally lives upto being a Boutique Hotel with so much space inside that you do not feel confined or enclosed in a property. If you know what I mean...10/10 recommended."
"One of the best hotel in kolkata, Food qualities are very delicious ...
Staff's are very cooperative...
Specially Pinky Barman..  She is very helpful.. Thank You Rajkuthir Team for the amazing experience.."
"I fall short of words to describe the beauty of this place - be it the food, the comfort, the rooms, the decor - it's AMAZING!! What made it even better were the extremely courteous staffs with their smiling faces and relentless efforts to make our stay pleasurable. Special thanks to Mr. Aritra, for arranging our stay. Also, I would like to specially mention staffs like Sanjay, Dilip, Manabi, and others who always ensured that we are comfortable. Rajkutir is nothing short of BLISSFUL, in a word. It doesn't fail to provide the much-needed escape from the boredom we all are stuck with. We have been there twice already and would like to revisit soon!"
It was lovely place for outing and staying with family and friends ... we enjoyed a lot .. delicious food we njyng the meal 😋😋😋😋🥰🥰we will cm to nxt visit for sure... i want to njy nxt visit with your guidance 😇

Thanks for your service..Happy Bijoya to all.."
Amazing hospitality. Great food. Nice rooms. It's perfect for a weekend getaway. The staff was super helpful and very accommodating. They have a very interesting menu and everything tastes really nice
"Very recently I did travel to this property to spend my good time with my family. I have Spend about 10k to get complete experience. Once I was check out I felt I have given more what I was expecting on 10k. 
Hotel check in process was quick and Aritra and Lovely was really helpful and courtesy. Our luggages was sanitized before it could send across to the room. Room was very nice and it was completely different from any other hotels. For guest safety they provide mask and sanitizer in room.
Evening we have enjoyed with traditional dance performance in hotel. Breakfast was nice and good we have enjoyed alot also the staff at restaurant are good.

Over all I give 5 out of 5. Thank you for your hospitality."
"Our visit to Rajkutir was overwhelming. The Banquet team did a wonderful job. The hospitality was unmatchable. All our guests had good thing to say about all.needleas to say the food quality has improved immensely from the time I used your place, whic was about over four years back. Would love to use your venues if opportunity comes. Thanks a ton."
"The property is aesthetically done and every corner is beautiful. Hospitality was amazing. Ms Lovely at the front desk was very helpful and accommodating throughout our stay that made the occasion we went to celebrate  even more special. Every meal was tastefully curated. The gentlemen serving and hosting us at the restaurant were very warm, I wish could name them."
"First of all I want to give them more than FIVE STAR.  I went here yesterday to celebrate my husband's birthday. It was a very nice experience. Thanks for the wonderful hospitality. special thanks to Sraban. He has been helping me all the time since I booked here. And Chef Swarnendu’s food was awesome. The ambience of the property gives us a very soothing factor. Everyone is very helpful, well mannered. I like it so much that I can't finish saying it. I shall recommend this hotel for everyone. MUST VISIT."
"Sir thank you very much for the hospitality and services given for the stay and the conference from 25 February to 1st of March to 350 delegates.
The staffs were very good sepcially sagar,Rahman, joydeep, partha to name a few
Thanks once again"
"Stayed there for a day and loved the hospitality. Want to thank Mr. Tayab Hussain at the reception who made sure my check in was done quick as I was in a hurry. He made sure I got a cab quickly and booked a table for me as well as my phone was switched off. Thanks for going out of the way and helping me out.

The Lalit is also associated with The Robin Hood Army which is a volunteer based, zero-funds organization which has its presence in 14 countries and works to get surplus food from restaurants and the community to serve less fortunate people. Loved how hotels are thinking of giving it back to the society, great work team Lalit."
"We have hosted our family get together in the restaurant after long time and our experience was so nice and memorable,Kudos to entair F&B team 
We will come back again ,Keep rocking and we can say one of the best restaurant in Kolkata"
"It was a wonderful experience ,everything is perfect from entering the hotel, food was delicious🧑🏻‍🍳ambience is perfect ,staff are very professional with there work and positive attitude towards each and every guest the way they attending to each and everyone..will recommend must visit place👍 kudos to entire team for making a memorable day.."
"This is my second visit to your restaurant Alfresco. Very happy to see all procedures starting from booking till every arrangements. I called up hotel and put a request to call back with details. Got call back within 1min from restaurant manager and upon conversation he shared every details I required instantly. 

We came on time and everything on place. Special thanks to the organiser team. Food is excellent and happy with smiling faces around. Positive energy all around. Service team always ensure the customer need. They took our feedback during lunch. Also keen to know if I need anything else apart from the buffet. 

Since it's a special day I have been asked to pay the booking amount in advance. But I was struggling to do bank transfer. The moment I informed them they share me a manual procedure step by step to pay through gpay - This is very impressive assistance. Although I expect a QR code payment for such big organization.

Overall exceeded our expectations like last time. Will visit soon."
"Lalit hotels in general always lives up to the expectations, be in terms of their location, food & Beverage, Rooms or there general service & Courtesies. 

This one is an excellent option to stay in Kolkata and enjoy the old world charm of the city, and cherish the comforts of good hospitality, and an experience worth every penny. 

It's a must recommended place!! 

Will certainly visit again."
"I stayed here for a Night for business trip and I found the location very central. Though people said that area around the hotel is not safe, but i found it quite safe. Staff was very helpful and even breakfast had good choice and nice food. Rooms are quite spacious and decently cleaned."
"It was an amazing stay at Lalit great eastern Kolkata. New year party was so much fun and the food was excellent. We ended our stay with a new year brunch which was an amazing experience .
Special thanks to the F&B and kitchen team for knitting beautiful experiences for the guests.
Looking forward for more such stays at Lalit."
"I had called in on the number available on Zomato and Google (033-44447777) at 10:40am on 12th February 2022, to make a lunch reservation in Alfresco. The representative (a lady) who took my call after having had introduced the hotel and hearing out my query disconnected on me in 12 seconds by stating ""Wrong Number!"".  I called in a second time upon which a gentleman took my call and was kind enough to transfer my call to the restaurant which after ringing 5-6times gave me a voice message of the phone being switched off. 

Such horrendous treatment of prospective guests is not expected from a supposed reputed establishment like Lalit. Please train your staff to treat your guests and prospective guests better.

Shall surely discourage my personal as well as professional circle from availing their services anytime in the future."
"When you come to a hotel like Lalit, you have great expectations that your trip is going to be worth it, but that wasn't the case. The staff were abrasive and the only thing that interested them is to empty your pocket. Shout out to Mr Abhrup Poddar for providing me and my buddy terrible service, and that wasn't the worse thing, I heard him yelling, berating, even to some extent harassing one of his fellow employees(who I believe is an intern) one should not treat another human being in that way. That shows how shallow-minded one can be. People like him are the reason why this world is a messed up place. And also shout to pannalal or whatever his name is. The guy solely cares for tips. He fought with one of his colleagues to take my luggage to my room. That clearly sets the standard of this pathetic hotel. This just shows that HR is doing a lousy job and should bring in people a bit more genuine. Thank you for setting the bar so low, so that the next time I go to a dhabba I'll have a better experience."
The stay was really very satisfying and pleasant hope to back soon .. The front office staff Mr Tayab Hussain and all the trainees are really very helpful  and Rima Biswas from reservation is very sweet .. Thank you will recommend others too. Place is near esplanade which is a center of the Kolkata .. They look after my every request
"Pros:
1. staff are nice and welcoming - such as mr bapan Giri in the restaurant. mr Abhirup in the front desk
2. food is good
3. good location

Cons:
1. hotel smells old and dingy
2. bugs in rooms. poor housekeeping."
"The oldest standing hotel in Asia. A bit underwhelming when we first entered the rooms. Decently sized and constructed, but maintained not greatly. But the staff compensated fully. Very warm and cooperative. Front desk was always pleasant. The spa Manager was very nice and cordial. The restaurant staff also was extremely welcoming. Giri served us very well throughout. Overall a very homely and warm experience."
"Except the ""name"" The Great Eastern nothing else here impresses anyone. Its just another Star Category Hotel. The Breakfast buffet arrangements seriousely missing professionalism. The stone hard Idlis are arranged in such a way that the buffet dispenser has a lid which should be kept apart on a plant pot while serving! This arrangement makes the stone hard idlis to get concrete! 

I stayed for 3 days and all 3 days iI pointed out the discrepencies to the concerned floor incharge at Buffet counter and the same fell on deaf ears!. 
Management should send these people to a Hotel in Bangalore to get more expertise in catering.  The floor of the Breakfast Buffet looks like uncleaned since British Regiem. The glass roof of the Buffet breakfast area too looks like the St. John's Church !!

The Rooms are just below Average than any 5 star hotels in Bangalore. I stayed in the new 3rd block 5th floor. Room no.3525.

They should rename the Property as  ""La Littered,  The not so Great Eastern"".

The entire Hotel doesnt look like the one displayed in the picture in any angle!!!

Totally not recommended property at this price range! Thanks."
"Our stay in the hotel was simply excellent. The hotel staff was ver courteous. I must mention and thank Mr. Tayab Hossain in the front desk. He was so very helpful. He always enquired about our comfort. I would like thank him specially for arranging our Covid 19 test and arranged to get the results in a short time as our flight was in odd hours. We will return again to the hotel.

"Our stay at Lalit was amazing and the staff is very helpful. Breakfast buffet was delicious and Mr. Bapangiri especially provided exceptional service and took great care of each and every need. 
Highly recommend!"
"This is the best place to stay amazing hospitality and food.
I thank the Lalit team and Bapanjiri who took care of us.
My kids wanted to come back here again.

We loved this place if you are planning to visit kolkata choose TheLalit.
Namaskaar!!"
Had a very pleasant experience. The staff right for the reception to room service was extremely welcoming and prompt. Buffet breakfast had a limited spread but the food was really delicious. The staff set the bar really  high as far as the hospitality is concerned!  Highly recommended! 
We had an amazing time at the Legacy suite. Spent 31st with friends and had a ball. The service was very good and the staff were super helpful. The food was good too and the New Years bash was fun with amazing crowd. Will definitely recommend this place.
"We stayed at LaLit Great Eastern in December 2021.
If you feel overwhelmed with the exaggeration and pushy behaviour of Oberoi hotels’ staff that turns your stay uncomfortable, and want to find some peace, the LaLit is an option you should consider.
The staff was welcoming, but not pushy, helpful and informative. Whatever problem we had, it was solved professionally. 
As we travel with kids, I appreciated that I did not have to remind the housekeeping all the time about the number of towels we would need - to give you an example.
What we found troubling was the restaurant. Not only it did not have much variety of food (plenty of options from the menu were not available), but the service was quite irritating. The food took a long time to arrive, but even longer sometimes to place the actual order: although there was plenty of waiters around it took a long time to get noticed, another long time to get the menu (the QR code), even longer for the waiter to come back and take the order. Not mentioning the time when one of the “managers” prevented the waiter to take our order. 
The restaurant experience weighed heavily on our experience with the hotel."
"Its a wonderful experience in The lalit great eastern,  food was awesome as always in lalit. Hotel ambience is excellent,  gymnasium is perfectly excellent.  Rooms are good for perfect and comfortable stay.
Wolud like to stay more in future also."
"Very polite and friendly staff.nice and clean rooms
Everything is close to hotel.service is super good .
Check in was also given early at request.do visit .
Worth for money.bara Bazar is very close .
They also gave us special kids privilege"
"I am Anand Shreekar, a US citizen living in Los Angeles, California , USA.  We flew from USA to get my daughter's wedding functions solemnized at Lalit Great Eastern Hotel, November 8-21, 2021. We had booked 40 rooms for our guests  spread over that period with about 160 room nights and also the banquet halls for the wedding functions.

The hospitality of the hotel was par excellence. The demeanor of  hotel staff ranging from the front desk,  bell boys, janitors, waiters, restaurant managers, security guards , gym instructor , banquet, sales, spa staff was unparalleled. The front desk ladies were the best and Priyanka Jaiswal stands out.  Anita  Paul from the restaurant was absolutely great.

The food at the restaurant was the best we have eaten in any hotel in India ,Europe or the USA.  My family and guests thoroughly enjoyed the stay at the hotel . The bakery items were world class.

Meraj Faiz, the Revenue Manager resolved all the billing issues amicably.

I personally thank the entire staff of the hotel for their hospitality with a personal touch.

"Visited kolkata for 2 days on a business visit and I'm very glad that I chose Lalit as the hotel. Very friendly staff, great breakfast (dosas 👌), huge gym filled with equipments and all of this in a prime location of the city."
"Felt like home 
Hygienic place
Inviting aura.
Impressive service by the staff.
Room charges mostly include breakfast...have buffet service...the food was really tasty and the washrooms are really well maintained
The infrastructure as well as the interiors are really eye catching.
Rest assured it's a great place to stay."
"I was searching for a good Christmas cake for a while now . I had the Belgian chocolate cake at Lalit over 8 years ago . I’ve not had the opportunity to try it again thanks to me being in and out of the city for ages . But finally this time I was able to get a hold of it . The taste , the flavour , the texture and the quality was the same , if not better still years after . Special thanks to Mr. Chandan , their restaurant manager who helped me with the entire process and went above and beyond his ways to help me choose , order and collect the cake . 10/10 would recommend and visit again ."
It wasa pleasant stay at the hotel. Heritage hotel with spacious rooms and good view.thr food at the breakfast was good and can increase the variety. We missed the Christmas party heard good things about it.
"Great place for a short stay. Centrally located, well connected to rest of the city. Great food and ambience. Hygienic stay during these uncertain times. The service was excellent, staff were friendly and eager to assist."
Came here with a bunch of friends for our reunion and it was such a lovely visit. Great hospitality and lovely breakfast. Would love to come back again . Thanks team ! The team was very accommodating and allowed us to party . I am sure we were a nuisance but they didn’t complain !
What a wonderful stay it was ! The people were so good they provided  us the best service It felt like a home for us it was our first stay in Lalit and it was a memorable one we had a chance to stay in such a beautiful heritage property of the 80's will definitely recommend it to my close one and will love to visit again  Thank you for the great hospitality  you provided us ❤
"Hotel is good ... Neat n clean ... But need more items in breakfast items ... In terms of cleaning n hospitality , they are upto the top class... Its great help from Zahirda n Mainak ... Keep up the good work ..."
"Avoid the Breakfast here. This is my 3rd stay here and you can clearly see that something is wrong now with the Breakfast spread. No varieties and simply pathetic. The top management please maintain your standard. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT LET THIS PROPERTY DEGRADE because of this deplorable Breakfast at your place. Please do something. Today is my 2nd day… and same pathetic breakfast, and the most ironical part is that since yesterday, we are not able to talk to the person Incharge for this Breakfast. Now, also it seems that he is available only after noon. 
Pathetic"
Had a pleasant stay at lalit. Easily accessible to metro. Staff at the concierge and house keeping are friendly.  Gave us itinerary too and it helped us a lot. Would definitely recommend it to others..
"We visited for a few days in November and had an amazing stay. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are well maintained. However, it is the service that takes the cake. The staff was very helpful at both the front desk and the restaurant. Special shoutout to Zahira who helped us plan various activities! We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Kolkata."
"i have travel around more then 50 countries of the world, and all star-non star hotels,  I have, rest house, motels, hostel and many other place, spent three night in the Lalit Great Eastern Kolkata, after seeing as No 1 rating in Trip Advisory Sight but I made mistake by choosing, as the First worst experience after having room was their Flush Valve in washroom was running continuedly with water!!!!! secondly AC was not working well, we found worst thing that as per given list of amenities in room, we had to ask for each and every small thing like sleeper, toiletries like soap was only on wash basin and not at shower area, shower gel was not place, moisturizer  was not placed, no shoe shiner was in room, only one Mineral water bottle between to of  was place and when we called for all this it took 2 hours 30 minutes to reach us after several call to the team that too after changing room due to water flowing in washroom toilet!!! Next Moring we get ready for breakfast and  called house keeping to clean room, could not complete by the time we came back after 90 minutes also,  in breakfast as written on their website it was not even half sprayed , only two variety of breads in such category hotels, two cereal only, cold milk was not cold, juice only one,  no honey, Jam where placed in buffet!! in even fresh cooked where very limited staff was in-experience as they was not known to many things and have to called for every such small thing to senior person of coffee shop or chef, over all I would say that breakfast in some remote country like Burundi Novotel or Sofitel have better then my experience in Lalit Great Eastern, after attending one function of marriage ceremony when we went to room same way we need to ask for each and every other amenities which should be refill in washroom and drinking water!!! that too have to call for two three times then it comes and feel that i am beggar,  this was continues for all three night in the restaurant even while having one Dinner too, and worst experience was wi-fi excess for which they took one night to resolve my issue, as there was NO TECHNICAL PERSON IN HOTEL DURING NIGHT HOURS TO RESOLVE IT, and there was no regret by any staff or lobby manager or front desk or general manager too!!  except ambience of hotel was only we found good due to ancient structure, and location was not also so great!!!! I would rate only one star for their services, and would never recommend to visit this hotel but all Lalit group of hotels as found and feel some of their policies and hospitalities where pathetic type with NON - EPERIENCE staff every where in hotel as well as  have NO AUTHORIES TO DECIDE ANYTHING ON THEIR OWN AND NEED TO ASK SENIORS FOR EVERY SUCH SMALL MATTERS!!"
best hotel for business stay . the location is the best part it is in the heart of the city .the stay was amazing The staff were very helpful and cooperative will definitely visit again all the civil protocol were obey
"It was amazing for us to visit this hotel. Staffs and attendant s were very co-operative. Liked the gesture. 
Rooms are perfect for two people. 
Suggestions
Covid protection (PPEs )accesories could have been added. 
If possible please add evening breakfast."
"It was a lovely stay at this heritage property with a long history. The highlight was the service. The team was warm and friendly all through. The staff were pretty helpful and prompt with their response. There was hardly anything to complain - be it with house keeping, waitstaff at their restaurant or the front desk.  Also, the rooms were spacious and functional and all the facilities were up to date.

On the whole, it was a nice stay and surely wouldn't mind repeating the experience. Looking forward to being back here soon!"

Stayed here on a business visit. Spacious and very comfortable rooms. The buffet for breakfast is pretty good. Dinner buffet as well as a la carte menu is just to die for. Chef sent a dish made of Betki fish which was so completely unlike any other fish dish I’ve had before! I was mind blown! Special mention to Zahida at the Front desk and Sangram from the room service department for being such an amazing staff. Extremely accommodating staff. I’ll definitely stay in this hotel during my next visit.
Best hotel for business trip . Staffs from the front desk was very cooperative and humble They gave me a wonderful service will definitely visit again all the covid protocols were followed overall a wonderful stay
The hotel infrastructure was very good All the focus protocols were followed The food was very good The staff were helpful and cooperative the rooms were properly made . Will definitely visit again ….
Very Fantastic Stay and Comfortable for the Guest to be in like Luxury. Beautiful infrastructure and the curtious staff and very humble and sweet like Rasgulla. Vow effect all days and always with the Lalit Charasmatic stay.
"The staff was courteous, they allowed early check-in and helped with onboarding. The food was also nice and the rooms were clean and very well maintained. Would suggest anyone who comes to Kolkata, the should stay here since it is at a prime location."
The stay and the service is excellent. The decor is nice. The staff is helpful and really cooperative. The stay was memorable and excellent. The interiors and the rooms are comfy. The rooms are well maintained and excellent room keeping services.
It was very mesmerizing  while staying here and staff was very friendly. My room was very clean and room service was very fast. My family really enjoyed it and all the meals at are provided by hotel was excellent and we also tried kolkata dishes which were mind blowing.

"Had a great time! Comfortable and pleasant stay! Extremely close to all markets and places to visit!  
We managed go walk to almost all places of interest near by.

The sanitation and house keeping was absolutely great"
Had a amazing time in this heritage property. Well maintained. 😊Staffs are well trained and Negative from reception is very attentive and very helpful. Looking forward to coming back again. 🙂food was mouth watering and the breakfast is quite delicious
The hotel rooms are very neat & hygienic. The rooms are quite specious. Nice food. All frontline staffs specially from reception Neha and a Housekeeping guy are very smart & well behaved. Felt homely during my 15 days stay at Lalit.
"While the city was busy with its festivities, we sneaked past our homes to enjoy the Durga Pooja at Kolkata. Not a very ideal time to explore this city in the heat of the day but here we were, making the best out of our mundane office lives. For stay we chose The Lalit which comes with its own rich history, and it surely did well to keep up with the rich culture of hospitality. We were greeted by Miss Priyanka Jaiswal at the reception who was very helpful and turned out to be an amazing hostess, be it guiding us about the city to helping us plan the great eastern meals. She and her staff made sure we were well serviced, giving us another reason to visit the city at much better time to enjoy the city in cooler months (was not accustomed to this humidity and October heat). Do opt for the mahabhoj in case visiting during Navratri."
"Lalit Great Eastern is one of the finest in Kolkata. Located in the heart of city. Cleanliness and Hygiene is Very well maintained.Spacious Rooms with good all required facilities. Staff is helpful and quick to respond polite and always happy to help. Passing through any area of the hotel you are very well greeted.
.Namaste 🙏🏻 is what you will hear from the moment you step out the car until you leave the hotel."
I'm a frequent traveler and always I choose lalit as my first choice because the service which I recieved it's always good and the customer service is amazing and thank you @Neha and team for your valuable service and hope you guys will keep the same always
"Ordered a birthday cake from Lalit kolkata for my wife.
The cake was designed as per requirement .
Rima was excellent  in coordinating till end of delivery.
The cake tasted absolutely wornderful .
Very good work done by chef Ayan on this .
I would love to thank Rima and Ayan to make my wife birthday a memorable one ."
"So I had a great experience of leisure & pleasure at this heritage property.
Warmly welcomed by mrs.bose at the bakery with quick bites and most alluring chit chats over tea .
The food indeed was economical , palatable and had a great portion size .The old word charm can be felt while taking a tour of the property & very well explained by Mrs bose. Mr.gupta was always there to make me comfortable and feel at ease at this heritage property.
On arrival at the spa we were welcomed by the detox tea which was really refreshing .the spa therapist was really professional and had absolutely relaxing  body scrub and head massage.it was really soothing after the tiresome weekend of puja.I would recommend everyone to be a part of this heritage property whenever they come to Kolkata.
I'm planning a staycation soon ! More details sooner on my next review."
Had a great buffet on Ashtami. Amitava and Agniva guided us through some good times. The food was awesome. The spread had varieties. Ambience was just superb. The sweets at village market was an excellent idea. Thanks.
"Every food was perfect. The Risotto gambroni was the best risotto I ever had. And Biswanath left no scope to devoid us of thr best service a man visiting a restaurant could expect.

The cocktails were awesome.
And so was the food."
If you want to experience heritage with the luxury you won't find a better one in Kolkata. The staff is extremely helpful and if you are visiting during Durga Puja you would get delicious cuisine. The hotel has maintained the history dated back in 1800 and you would still see the reminiscent preversed here.
I had an amazing stay at the hotel and enjoyed the Party during this Puja. The hospitality is polite and was very LGBTQIA+ community friendly. I wish for more visit and more beautiful experiences. Taking a lot of memories with me.
Spent 4 days.. was a lovely stay . Nice gesture.. thanks a lots... The staff was very friendly. Specially thanks to Rima. She  decorate our room.. thanks.. hope to see you soon once we are back from mumbai again.
"We friends decided to party, and we stayed over Lalit to reduce the tiredness and they were an excellent host hope to stay with them
Again when we come for a party and staycation. 

The staff is very courteous and they have made sure we get things at the time of need. Thanks team."
Dropped in to savour on their special Durga Puja delicacies on Maha Sasthi. Wonderful experience of the #FourPillarsofKolkataCuisine. Right start to the festivities. Loved the food and the hospitality!
nice place...great hospitality.pleasent experience overall...good for couples in lalit and moreover the outside ambience is also soothing and comfortable...must visit for everyone to spend a nice time with friends and family...
"My family and I had a fantastic experience here. The food at the buffet was delicious and had a great variety. And the service from our server, Viswanath, was excellent considering our party ranged from my 94 year old grandpa to my 1 year old nephew. Highly recommend!"
Fantastic stay with delicious food. Breakfast spread was also nice. Rooms are sanitised and clean. Staffs are very courteous and helpful specially Neha and Ritam in front desk. Will definitely visit again.
"Staff is good, priyanka Mukherjee, priyanka jaiswal,are an asset to the organization,  very well trained and professional 
Thanks a lot for all the servics provided
Will visit again here 
Thanks and all the best"
"This is a basic 3 star hotel, at 5 star rates. 

Pros: Good service, staff 

Cons: View of slums from room (5th floor), very spartan amenities, basic toiletries, no fruit bowl/fresh flowers, no welcome drink, peeling paint at entrance. Very congested locality and facade unlike the cleaned-up photo on Tripadvisor.

We did not eat the food or the breakfast."
"I had good experience staying there , hotel has a very good location and offers good size of room. good breakfast buffet. but only down point is the staff are either less or not willing to work. so, I would say it’s a good value for money when you visit for business purpose."
Very well managed heritage hotel. Kind and courteous staff . Even trainees are well groomed and professional. HOTEL INFRATRUCTURE IS GOOD .In case of a rainy day you can enjoy your drinks beneath the glass ceiling at food court. Very well connected to Kolkata's business district and downtown.
The ambience and buffet was amazing. The service provided by Mr. Biswanath Mondal was exceptional. Worth the experience for a fantastic evening! The starter items and the non veg ones were equally delicious!
"Wonderful stay. Everything is sanitized rooms are clean. Staffs are very well trained and helpful specially Neha and Priyanka, They were very humble and polite. Food was delicious. Will plan to come back soon."
"Excellent experience - returning to the Lalit felt good.  The service is warm, the amenities and the choice of food is great.  The staff are very courteous.  Coupled with its central location, the stay was enjoyable and comfortable.  Definitely worth specially the trainees are hard working and the trainee in front office name Priyanka is very soft spoken"
"Room is neat & clean,staff are all very nice and food is like yummy😎.staffs were very helpful specially Ms.Neha and Mr.Tayab. Rooms were clean and sanitized. Priyanka and Ekta were also very helpfull. Will come back soon."
"From the moment you step in,the warmth and grandeur of this place makes sets you in awe..Well designed spacious rooms,friendly staff,impeccable  hygiene and most importantly, the food is to die for.

We checked in for a staycation on the invitation of a Dear friend,Sourav Gupta On the occasion of my Husband's Birthday.He and Mr chandan from the restaurant  made our stay a truly memorable  one. THE personalized room decorations ,the attention to detail on the cake,the baby food served to room with the right consistency of mashed potato,talk about a customized experience  and you have it here.Posting some pictures to give an idea of the experience.

The food is just mind blowing,This is hands down the best indian I have had in years..

Last but not the least,Sourav took us for a tour of the bakery and the entire property, which was the highlight  of our stay,If you want to feel the warmth and soul of old Kolkata,along with its charm,this is the place."
"Good property with delicious breakfast, 
All the staffs are very helpful, particularly Ms. Neha from the front desk.

"Attended a friend's birthday ceremony.

Nice decor along with super treat to tastebuds.. specially the bakery goods .. blackforest is worth mentioning.. 
Overall great experience and recommendable "
"I went to The Lalit Great Eastern - Alfresco with mum and dad for my bday lunch. 
While the hotel is absolutely lavish, the food is equally mouthwatering....especially the angara kumbh (mushroom) and carrot onion kulcha. The staff are very well behaved and provide the best of services maintaining all covid 19 safety protocols. They helped us choose their signature dishes and even guided us with the quantity that we should order. The food was absolutely delicious and my parents and I had a great time today. 
The Lalit Great Eastern made my bday truly memorable."
"We ordered for dinner home delivery on 15 tg august 2021. We had combo under special offer as well as ala kart chinese and conti dishes. Real good experience - starting from ordering to delivery at home. We enjoyed tge food also..  All excellent. All are very customer friendly. Great.

"While the hotel has all the typical luxury elements of a classic LALIT property, it suffers a bit from the fact that it is located in a very old building that's in the most chaotic part of the old town! A crumbling facade, being locked around on all sides by grimy buildings etc. However the property has done a good job of preserving and celebrating its heritage treasures. Everything from old furniture and architectural elements - from the colonial times when it was the GREAt EASTERN hotel - is beautifully showcased. So do take a tour around the property if you can. A stay at the property is like an encounter with history in Calcutta. 

LOCATION: Awesome location in the heart of old calcutta, and stone’s throw away from all historic attractions.

DINE + DRINK: The breakfast was very disappointing with an extremely poor choice of food. I didnt travel to calcutta all the way from Bangalore to be served only a limited spread of south indian food for breakfast! They should showcase bengali favorites being in Calcutta!

ROOM: We stayed in room 3608 - so this review is based on that; VIEW:Sweet view of the city and Howrah bridge ; SIZE: Very spacious room; AIR-CON: Not cool enough; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part to put me to sleep; BATHROOM: Stand in shower; TOILETRIES: Lovely Spa quality Cosmetics from KRONOKARE brand

FACILITIES: Very decent Gym with a good range of weights and Cardio machines, perfect for a full on workout! The swimming pool was closed during our stay

SERVICE: Friendly staff that took care of all our needs with a smile and made us feel pampered and well taken care of. Special Shout out to the Front office manager who enhanced our stay, and the PR & Marketing person who gave us a lovely tour of the property

HOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free medium speed Wi-Fi that works well all over the property. Big Plasma TV screen  but channel selection was HIGHLY LIMITED! So you are better off sticking to your devices and online subscriptions!"
"A fantastic stay in a cosy heritage hotel. Great hospitality, and experience. The place is renovated but the essence of the British era stays… every nook and corner has a story to tell . The decor is impeccable. We enjoyed our staycation. Every staff was welcoming and supportive"

Great experience to be in touch... Vikas was so approachable for any assistance and support.

"As event managers collaborating with Westin was a breeze. The staff were very helpful and cooperative making our production process smoother.
Not only do they have an incredible banquet, their catering service and accommodation is also excellent. 
We would also like to especially thank Dibendu for being graciously accommodating and helpful.

"The Lalit Great Eastern is one of the Best Hotel to stay in Kolkata. Well designed and spacious rooms with good amenities. Food is Good and Tasty. Very prompt  helpful staff. Cleanliness hygiene is very well care for. Choice of Restaurants, cuisine, Tea Lounge and Pub all under one roof. Truly a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️star experience."
"I have always loved Lalit.. For one: The kind of hospitality and warmth I receive right from the valet till I reach the room is quite unmatchable I would say.

My overall experience - which includes our stay, the food, the people/staff.. it's just right..!! How I would want in a hotel.. Nobody's perfect.. but I can tell that Lalit is doing the best with all that's been going around."
The property is very nicely maintained and staff is very courteous and they maintain proper hygiene which is pretty much necessary in current pandemic situation I could have given more than five stars if it was feasible to rate above. In crux very comfortable stay feels like homely.
"Many thanks for your cooperation yesterday & today.The Fresh Mango Cake was like a signature item and all the items in the Non-veg buffet were delicious & non-spicy-just as we had hoped they would be.Really appreciated the culinary experience.Even the buffet is always consistent and never ‘hit or miss’.

The customer service mindset of Mr.Anand Rawat of Lalit Loyalty department always stands out and thanks to him,I am really enjoying the program both dining out at Alfresco during& ordering in."
"Clean and safe place to eat breakfast, social distancing is maintained and all people're wearing masks. Good hospitality and warm services from all staffs. We'll come again for sure. We would definitely recommend this hotel. It has ticked all the safety precautions during Covid-19. Sanitizers could be found everywhere, Staffs wore face masks and plastic gloves 100% of the time."
"We had an awesome 3 days/2 nights stay at Lalit☺️ We booked with family and friends to celebrate my birthday and we really had a great time there.

Other than the amenities and the perfect view from our beautiful room, what we truly appreciated the most was the treatment we received from all the staff. They are so welcoming and everyone was smiling and greeting you, it made our stay really wonderful.

Also, thank you to the manager on duty (Chandra) he helped us a lot when we faced a minor setback. He even called the next day to check if everything was okay already.

Kudos to everyone and see you again soon 😊"
"I had a 9 day stay in the Lalit, converted as a satellite covid facility by AMRI. Big spacious room. The service and attention was impeccable. They made food for me as per my taste and we're always available when required. Highly recommended."
Great hotel.. situated in a prime location with easy access to the airport and city center. Great staff.. hospitality is great. the ambience is really nice and the covid protocols are strictly followed!
"ITC experience is always amazing. All COVID protocols followed. Prompt service. Staffs are super friendly. Room was real pleasant. Located in one of the prime place yet it brings you close to nature with almost no sound of the outside world. Food is real good. Must mention about Mr. Bireswar Mondal from housekeeping. He fixed the room in super less time and have been extremely kind. Such a nice gentleman. Thank you soo much.

A couple of things that the management may look into:
1. Check in process can be better. I had to wait nearly 30 mins as only 1/4 counters were in operation. In the busy time you got to operate all 4 counters.
2. Orders at breakfast table at Eden Pavillion can be served on time. I ordered something from live counter which never came."
Absolutely amazing feel staying here the ambience is amazing and the staffs are really nice and helpful beautiful view from the room special shoutout to shailza and mr wahid for making it really nice out here . Really nice food too
"Very good service . Perfect for family, friends, business, leisure trip. It's very beautiful . The staff are very Cooperative. Shailza and Shreya were very courteous. Rooms are very clean. The property is very old but we'll maintained."

Stunning hotel with courteous staff. Was here to meet a friend and I was greeted by sreya and she offered me welcome drink as well.

Very spacious property
"Like a long guest in ITC property it is very pleasure to coma and get breakfast in Eden Paivillion.

"Amazing hotel,it's natural environment makes it stand apart from others. I am enjoying the stay here.
It has a attractive expanse of beautifully designed garden with lush palm and coconut trees and gentle water bodies dotted with water lilies , colourful fishes and complemented by the artful minimalism of the hotel’s architecture, ITC Sonar offers an unusual leisure environment for a 5 star luxury business hotel."
"Bireswar has been exceptional in taking care of us. We could tell him anything and he would adhere to the timeline and deliver us at no time.
The overall experience has been fabulous.
ITC really lived up to its expectations"
This was my first visit in ITC sobar. It was amazing. Everything from hospitality to restaurants everything was upto the mark. Nawab ji helped me a lot . And also shailaja cre of ITC sonar. She was very helpful.
"Had the most amazing stay in ITC, SONAR. Extremely happy with the hospitality and services we received. Extremely comfortable and instant response to our needs and stay. Would definitely recommend for a peaceful and absolutely comfortable stay.

The food is absolutely amazing, the breakfast spread is healthy and tasty, perfect for a start of an exciting day. The staff is extremely cordial and are very accommodating to all the needs."
"At first instance I amazed with the atmosphere and food quality.. The staff behavior, food quality, Decorations everything is perfect. First experience at ITC Royal is amazing. At this covid situation all safety measures followed. Super experience."
"Visiting this hotel after a gap of 5 years and a new hotel has come up right next to it by the same group. I stayed at both the hotels and so this hotel seemed a bit old and also there are hardly any residents here.

 I got a room on the first block facing the road and it is clean and well maintained. The beds are comfortable and the room is well equipped with all the amenities. The breakfast buffet is not as amazing as on my last visit."
"Good, timely service and ambient staff. Helped me with problems such as restarting the TV. Immediate response to the issue. Gave good suggestions on planning trips here and also described many interesting facts about the hotel I was curious to know."
"What can I say about the hospitality of ITC Royal & Sonar, we all know how great it is.
I have been in ITC Sonar for 35days. during my stay, I find Bireswar Mondal (a house keeping boy) very polite & helpful. he know his job very well and his behavior is very good. I felt like home, next time will visit with my family.
.
Thanks & God Bless You All Staff."
"So I have been here for very long time and it feels like home. Everything is perfect over here. The perfect hospitality . Foods, restaurants, rooms, astonishing. I met a staff from front desk named shailija she was very polite and with good behaviour."
Great hospitality. Covid protocols of this hotel is very prompt. I'm  staying for long so I will recommend this to everyone. Beautiful  hotel with pond. Shailza from guest relation. Jyoti  and suburbs from ird . They took care of me really well.
Remarkable hotel to stay. Good  Service good and cooperative staffs. Enjoyed the stay and will definitely book for my next trip.  Will also advice my relatives and friends to stay or to organize any event in this hotel.
"Excellent, beautiful and well sound-insulated rooms offer respite from the busy streets of Kolkata. Very comfortable beds and everything here made with high end materials and finishes.  Breakfast buffet is also very good as well as the fact one can also easily get over to ITC Royal to their fantastic restaurants.  Front Desk is world class as are the housekeeping personnel.  Truly relaxing and wonderful stay!"
"It was my child’s 9th birthday and the staff went out of their way to make her birthday special. My daughter loves the ITC group of hotels and insists on visiting it every time. Loved the ambience of the room, the lily pond with fishes and ducks. Special mention to Sailja for making it special."
"Had a pleasant stay at ITC Sonar. 
The staff was very friendly and very accomodative. safety  measures and covid protocols were followed as per the norms.
It has a scenic beauty and is mesmerizing.
Rajiv, kaushik and Shailaja were very helpful."
"Quality Hotel.
We stayed with family in two rooms in Dec 21. The property is well laid out and interiors are good. We got early check in and the staff was supportive of our early arrival around 11 am.  We ordered room service and they delivered in good time. The food quantity was good  for 2 of us. 
The property is well laid out with the baganbari theme and it works well for this luxe place. The exterior needs a good refurb though. 
The break fast spread was good, though we would have liked a better variety of fruits. The bakery items were excellent and so were the choice of yogurt’s. The south Indian dishes were not upto mark ( maybe ‘cos we South Indians are used to better tasting South Indian dishes at home). But from my experience with other ITC properties in Mumbai and Delhi, the South Indian fare definitely need to improve in  kolkata hotel, considering this was their flagship property. 
The staff as usual are pay attention till they spot someone familiar or important. Then the attention drops and one need to catch the eye of the manager  or one of the staff.  We are used to this in  other business hotels, but not expected in a luxury property.  Better training or adding staff is required. 
Also, maybe due to Covid Restrictions, the cigar lounge and dum pukht were closed  for guests.  Would have loved to be in the cigar lounge and relax with their excellent cigars. It would have been a good idea to keep these open with appropriate distancing policies. The hotel was fairly well occupied when we stayed. 
There seems to be a feeling that ITC are shifting attention to the new Royal Bengal property ( maybe I’m wrong), and that this property may not receive the attention it deserves. 
All in all a good place to relax and laze around in the heart of city"
I have been staying in ITC Sonar for last 15 days and I find it a real nice place. Ambience is good and staff shows eagerness to address the requirement. Breakfast has variety. Food is spicy and spice lovers will enjoy dinner too
"The hotel maintains the COVID protocol properly
 The staffs are well mannered. The food was served hygienically. The interns are very good. I have talked to sayonika and she was very humble and we'll mannered"
I came here for the first time and the hotel was very beautiful as I heard. Specially the staffs are very cooperative. The hospitality that they gave was upto the mark. A lady named sailija was very kind and helpful.
The stay was very comfortable and lavishing. The COVID protocol are maintained as per norms. The food was very good. The staff are well mannered and I would definitely visit the property in nearby future
"Excellent place for stay ,foods are good delightful . zakuji steam bath is must try, some staff are rude but some are good specially one staff I met ""bireswar mondal"" Best man as i ever met helpful nature , caring personality"
"the rooms are really nicely maintained and the breakfast is really nice and delicious. the part i liked the most is the the ponds along with the fishes,ducks and water lillies. i think the outer area of this hotel is really beautiful."
"An Oasis in the Chaos of Kolkata, located opposite the Science city, Kolkata. A hotel with an outstanding landscape design by its American architect.

However, the entry to the hotel is most unwelcoming starting from the entry gate till the reception. A series of grumpy, unwelcoming faces and protocols. No smile, no welcome only some checks! 

Till you struggle to reach its slightly hidden reception, you are own your own- mostly Atma Nirbhar with your luggage and braving some very old and heavy glass doors.

As you reach to the reception, same experience of "" No smile"" "" no welcome"" ...or not even an welcome drink!

The reception guy behind the reception glass wall ( Pratik?) reminded me about the movie "" Sholay"" and it's "" angrez jamaane"" ke Jailor! Even before he handed over the room key, he gave me a long list of "" Do not Dos"" in the hotel....! By now, you may start cursing yourself for booking yourself in this hotel!!

But as soon as you got the key, some one comes and takes your luggage, and then guide you politely to your room. I was given a ground floor room 3004, next to the Swimming pool. A brilliant room layout and internal design. One starts liking the room as soon as you enter!

Later, I realised that I was upgraded to an ITC One room, thanks to the non smiling guy at the reception.

I continued to stay for 5 nights ( in two blocks) and I loved every bit of my stay here. The outstanding lotus pond in the central vista is a great hangout places.

Another USP of this property, is, there very friendly and always willing to help staff members every where, except when you enter! 

Morning Breakfast is served at the Eden Pavilion. It's a good spread but very very imaginative list of items and more problematic is the clumsy  sequence of these items!

But the floor manager, Mathew and his team are terrific in responding to all your needs from a Poori to a Masala Dosa. Very prompt and caring bunch of team! We loved this place!

If you love green and quite landscape, this hotel is for you! In the Chaos of Kolkata Traffic, this place is a sort of an Oasis."
"The location, ambience and the facilities are simply amazing .
Special mention to Mr Bireswar Mondal , from the housekeeping staff, he was polite, professional and very helpful, and made sure our stay was comfortable ."
It was so pleasent to have such a good service. Felt so familier and helping that it never felt like i was staying out of my home. Room service gesture always made me feel like home and put me at ease and comfort.
The hotel was absolutely awesome great hospitality. Food was super delicious and staff are very helpful and cordial. I have order some food at 1 Am and they provide it with utmost care. I would recommend to at least stay once the morning pond view was worth cherishing for.
"ITC Sonar – Every Bit Gold ..or More

After almost 2 years had a chance to stay in one of most favorite ITC Hotel Property .  This place evokes in me a feeling of home away from home . The Hotel is most luxurious , very calm & serene settings ..almost a resort like feeling .

"When I think of the best sushi in Calcutta, I always think of #PanAsian at #ITCSonar

I went on a girls’ night out with my mom and had a really great meal! The chef made a special sushi and sashimi platter with ebi and maki sushi as well as scallop, yellow tail and salmon sashimi! 

We also had the chicken suimai and prawn dumplings. They just melt in the mouth 😍

For mains, we ordered the garlic fried rice, Hakka noodles, Kung kratein prawn, chicken in chili bean sauce and Asian greens! The chicken and prawn are a must try, you won’t regret it!

For the finale, the showstopper was the tender coconut ice cream. You must must must try it! 

The service was par excellence - what you’d expect at @itcroyalbengal 
5/5 for food and ambience"
"Rooms and location are excellent. Amenities and other stuffs are excellent. One of the finest hotel in India where I have stayed in.  A special mention to Mr. Bireswar Mondal. He took care of us beautifully. Overall Great experience.

The breakfast has different variety for everyone, also on a sweet side as as An Italian, we usually prefer sweet. The service is up to the mark and it’s a must visit in Kolkata. Only small negative is the AC too high all over the hotel, so much that we has to go outside in the garden to feel a bit warmer. Thank You so much Sailaja for your support throughout the stay."

"I go regularly to ITC SONAR BANGLA, but this time I was a little disappointed with the service 

1. No Dental set 
2. Have to call twice or thrice to get something in my room. 
3. Bathroom door lock was not working. 
4. No one asked to ask about dinner trolly it was in the room till we check-out at 12noon. That is the reason I have to wait for 3 hours to get to my room. Just because it was not cleaned. I was not feeling well still they make me wait in the lobby for 3hrs. Even asking 5 times they have to time. 

Hope I don’t get the same experience next time."
Actually I came here to visit kolkata  to go to gangasagar . After that I came in itc  sonar it was wonderful  as expected upto the mark. The girl I met in itc named shailja helped me a lot. It was fabulous . Thank you so much itc sonar for this stay

The hotel has a very traditional yet contemporary aesthetics to it and The overall vibe is very soothing. 

The Dum Pukht restaurant was a delight and so was the massive breakfast spread. The staff is warm and welcoming and helped with the tiniest of request with a smile. 

Highly recommend and hope to experience other ITC properties soon."

Even the bathroom accessories are so good,and I would say that the revert back from the welcom assistance team is very good they responded to all my calls immediately when ever I called for anything.Thank you to everyone for this excellent stay of mine."
"Cozy and big rooms, ambience is quite natural and soothing.  A great stay with my friends over the weekend. 

Easy and smooth check in process and following l Covid appropriate behaviour by all during security check in and during stay. Breakfast especially south indian dishes are must try."
"First the good part. I checked in the resort at around 11 PM and asked for a late checkout of 4 PM next day and the request was immediately accepted. The property is nice and rooms spacious. There is a beautiful pond with fishes and ducks.

Coming to the areas of improvement.
1. In Room dining is not upto mark. Dishes are very limited. I ordered lunch and twice the wrong dishes were sent to me. Not expected from a 5 star rated hotel. Taste was very average for the kind of premium pricing.
2. Breakfast buffet was not upto mark. North Indian dishes were very very limited. Most of it was South Indian , Chinese and Continental. 

In a nutshell, given a choice I would not return but would like to explore other similar properties."
My stay in ITC Sonar was a pleasant one i loved everything about the hotel from the food to the kind of service they provide you with its just wonderful.I will definitely come back again.Thank you all once again.
"I had a great time in itc sonar.The property is really nice. We all came here for two days, these two days i enjoyed lot with my family.spend quality time over here.staff are very cooperative.would like to mention few of the staff name aditi ,vanda,maria"
"I stayed here for 3nights as I had come with my family.Everything is so beautiful about this hotel ,the food is so delicious as well.The hotel just had its own beauty which I think is the best thing about ITC Thank you to Aditi and Vanda for showing us the fish feeding."
"It was a super pleasant and a personalised experience where we had the best of everything. The stay, the comfort, the food. Truly it was being one with Nature where we fed the fishes and ducks. 
Perfect way to bring in the winter and my birthday."
Had an amazing dining experience at Dumpukht and Peshawari. I had been there for both my anniversary and a family dinner. The food was heavenly and I loved the way the staff explained us the its origin and what would go best with it as it was our first time trying these delicacies. Will surely come back to try something new on your menu and talk to such fine staff. Good luck!
I came here with my family on and I celebrated my birthday over here . The Peshawari Restaurant over here in which they gave md complimentary cake was mind blowing and also the dal makhni. As I am a foodie I loved the restaurants and hotel also . Thank you
Thanks to Shailja Gope. The Hospitality Is Very Good And Fantastic. I Love The Restaurants Tjough. And Also Palash And Sujoy Thanks To Both Of Them To Not Let Mw Stand .. Ambience Is Very Beautiful. Food Was Very Tasty.
"It was our first visit to ITC (both ITC Sonar and ITC Royal Bengal)property. Both the property has its own beauty.We were just so amazed by the ambience and beautiful hospitality.
Staff Aditi was of great help. We would love to visit it again.,"
"Had an amazing experience staying at ITC : most courteous staff,  Covid safety protocols across & amazing food, making this one of the best experience we had across all hotel we stayed till now.. Happy Diwali to all esp. the ITC Sonar staff for helping making it memorable at Kolkatta"
"Grand, majestic, marvellous fall short to define the grandeur of the place. The staff is very cooperative and courteous. Thankful to Shailaja who took me around the property. The pond , the fish , the ducks all make the visit so memorable."
"I had an amazing experience at this hotel. Every staff member that I encountered, from doorman, reception, server at breakfast to the housekeeping, were very helpful, warm and courteous. I would like to mention front desk staff were very accomodating and allowed us to check in early as I had put in a request. Manager Nirbhik was very kind to extend the same. Rooms were beautiful, clean and sanitized. Food was amazing. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to experience good hospitality."
I had come to This beautiful hotel ITC sonar which is the heart of kolkata and everything out here is so beautiful. The food variety is so much and tasty as well.So many fishes in the lily pond which makes it look even more beautiful. Thank you each an every one.
"It was a great experience keep it up.Really enjoyed everything from the food ,to the ambiance to the staff behaviour.Really spacious rooms with a great view!!!!
Could not have asked for more!I hope they keep it up!!"
"Being locals, we've never actually stayed here before. But the Grand being such an iconic institution, we decided to spend a night there and celebrate my mother's 75th birthday.
They made it very special for us indeed. We had balloons and festoons and roses and cakes....
The entire works in fact.
And the Grand is certainly a very charming place, no mistaking that. The building itself is a class apart. It has a lot of atmosphere. I especially loved the slightly eerie feeling I had after sundown, every time I looked at the shuttered original block. It was a place to let your imagination run wild.
But I would still say that all in all it was less than my expectation. But then in all probability the fault (if there be a fault at all) lies not in the hotel but in my exaggerated expectation.
So..... yes.  it's a five star."
We had an amazing time at Baan Thai on our first anniversary! Our server for the day was Asif & he was super courteous & suggested fantabulous dishes for us! All were super nice but a special shoutout for the papaya salad...it just blew our minds!
"Our experience at Oberoi Grand Kolkata was absolutely phenomenal. The highlight of the stay was the breakfast especially the amazing chef ; Satvik who prepared the Banana French toast and the courteous and empathetic staff members - Nilanjan, Subham , Chahat , Asif and Kashangwon and a host of other members. 

Given a chance , I would love to stay with them every time I am in Kolkata. Highly recommended and Would rate it exceptional for their services."
"If you want to experience true luxury you should visit The Oberoi Grand. I went to Baan Thai for a family dinner and the food was amazing but what made the difference was service staff. Ishali, Asif and Asif thank you for such a memorable experience."
"Great food and really spectacular service, especially by Asif. Definitely recommend coming here for some great dining experience.

Ambience is very nice. We had starters and mains, the meat was well cooked and overall great taste."
"This heritage hotel is a living piece of Kolkata history as so much about the city.  Wonderfully located, this classically elegant property is a pleasure to stay in. The staff are friendly and helpful. And do make time for Mr. Sircar’s property tour if you are a fan of history. He the longest serving staff at the hotel and is an institution in his own right!"
Everything was so beautiful. Starting from the great location amidst all the shopping hauls. Must visit if you are a travel and shopping freak. Starting from checkin to checkout Vicky was always there to help with all our needs. Thanks to him for the humongous packed breakfast  he left for us.
"Well this feedback traces back to my wanderlust visit in the property last to last week where I dragged myself to the The Bar hoping to have some drinks and head back home like always. But what makes me sit down and write this essay is my introduction to Vicky at the Front Desk. I came up with the most stupidest question and alas Vicky caught my attention by not answering it so stupidly. He walked me to the bar and cut to next half an hour I was 3 down. He really is a professional and knows his skills. Great speaker,  great company, great product knowledge, great ambassadoring skills. He even showed me around the hotel. As promised, shall definitely come back more and more often. Big shootout to Snehail and Nilanjan at the bar who were just awesome.

Love and support
Jacinta Tigga

It is an absolute pleasure to be back at hotel.

Firstly and foremost my very special thanks to Mr. Mayan Dhawan , who consistently tops my list👍🏼👍🏼

He fortunately is acting as the General Manager of Hotel, Undoubtedly He is the most deserving Candidate for same, Hats off to his down to earth nature, His team feels super relaxed in his presence.

Housekeeping means Mr. Belal Hamza for me, He round the clock is available and make sure that nothing goes wrong.

Agnelo , Koushikee , Sidharth Jha made sure our special mention.

At the Restaurant Ms.Ishali, Mahipal, Tanishka ,Debdut , Ronil

Special Thanks to Mr.Sarkaar"
"We had an array of items, both veg and non veg, ranging from soup to starters to main-course. Yummy! The Lotus stem, spring rolls, Tom yum soup, rice and Thai curry! A neat whiskey sour to go with as well. 

Thanks Tenzing for your patience and service! Must visit!"
"Mr Mayan and his entire team including Gurpreet and Chef Pappu Singh were brilliant. They really looked after me, and made me feel at home looking into the tiniest details. Mr Sayantan was specially helpful  and of course the Oberoi experience was immaculate as usual. What an awesome property, the pool side was like sitting in Goa and the Thai cuisine was to die for. 

Cheers 🥂🥂"
"amazing food, the sushi and pizza was exquisite. The person serving us was named abhishek and he was super helpful and recommended some extremely good dishes. The ambience was very nice and overall it was an good experience😄"
"We came for our 1st night after marriage and the team had made our stay extremely special with customised photo frames, room decor, cake etc. Vicky, Debolina, Rahul Sharma, Yangam, Alena were amazing and a special mention to Soumajit for arranging the most special stay ever for us. Thank you so much."
Our post covid lunch couldn’t have been better. Tenzing deserves a special mention for being super helpful and making it special for us.  Some preparations were better than the best I had in Thailand..
"Had a wonderful time at the Oberoi Grand, Kolkata in Feb 2022. The hotel easily combines the old world charm with modernity.
Great food and wonderful courteous staff  (Thanks to Chef Veeram and co). Thoroughly enjoyed breakfast on all the days there.
The front office too was very accommodating and handled our unique situation will deft understanding (note: we were in a secured bubble!).
Housekeeping and laundry services were exceptional and efficient. Special mention of Swetha Vishwakarma. She is very good at her work. Very affable, she made every effort to help out and to assist in every situation. A big thanks to her! 🙏

Would very much like to return to Oberoi Grand as soon as possible."
"Excellent experience at the Oberoi as usual.

Food was great. The traditional Ice Cream Sandwich is a classic and a highlight. The service was exceptional - in particular Debdutt was very friendly and helpful."
Thankyou for making our stay so comfortable and special mention to Ms. Gurpreet from front office for being so warm and making our stay so specia. I must say she is an asset to this property and i will surely visit soon
"Been there for the first time. It’s an awesome place to dine in..  all the foods are quite good.. the boy, Mr Tenzing took a very special care for us.. service was prompt.. too much helpful also suggested the menu.. worthy of a visit.."
Loved my recent stay at the hotel. I happen to stay at The Grand only because it was closest to my work area but it turned out to be the best decision. Starting from welcome to farewell the guys take care of every single thing. Thanks to Anjali who assisted through checkin and Vicky during checkout. He even got me the same room at good deals during busy period. Everybody else is great and does wonders in bringing a smile to their guests.
Special mention to Vicky to make our stay so so special starting the start. The rooms was breathtaking and nothing could have marked a better start to our stay. The breakfast was serene and we absolutely were full till lunch. Planning to visit soon whenever travel permits. Shall be looking out for Vicky always for his over the masks smiles.😊
"Loved the food as always! Baan Thai has forever been a favourite, and kudos to them maintaining their standards. Loved the pad Thai and Grilled tofu. Special thanks to Asif and Khitish for the great service."
"Back home after a short holiday last week at the Oberoi Grand, Calcutta. “Atithi Devo Bhava” seems to be the guiding philosophy of the staff. The four of us experienced this -  with those we met face to face, and the many who worked behind the scenes. Ms. Apoorva, Ms. Gurpreet, and others at the front desk welcomed us with a warm smile. Right from our initial request for connecting rooms, to more mundane needs like a yoga mat, were met. The restaurant staff were flexible to our desires – Chef Anna, Ms. Muskan, Mr. Abhishek, Mr. Sanejelo - to name a few – they were all uniformly attentive (pardon us - we do not remember other names ). Also, appreciate the services of Mr. Gidian of the housekeeping department. Mr. Mayan Dhawan took time out of his busy schedule to answer our queries about other Oberoi properties. And of course, the very amiable Mr. Amitava Sarkar gave us an informative and engaging historical tour of the hotel. Thank you all.  
 If you are visiting Calcutta, do explore the option of staying at the Oberoi."
"Excellent service, hospitality. A very friendly and war approach from the staff side, especially Mr. Debdut.
He gave us a very comfortable time right from the start in choosing the best to all the suggestions and friendly trip advices. Thanks Oberoi."
"The food was excellent.
We went for a lunch outing with family. 
And nothing  we ordered on our own. Our staff Ankit was kind enough to help us order and each food item that was ordered was great.
Definitely a thumbs up for every aspect of my dining"
"Great food. Great ambience. Khitish recommended some good dishes and took care of our requests. Very friendly staff. A must visit for people visiting Kolkata.
From cocktails to soup to starters all were superb. Even the desert was nice. All in all great experience."
"Excellent experience at the 363 restaurant. Special mention for Debdoot and Guni Khushi. Debdoot was very kind to suggest us the perfect food items to select from the menu, recommend heritage food items and the right cocktails to have. They also specially served an anniversary cake, making it special, would absolutely recommend giving a shout out for debdoot and Khushi if you visit this place, you would know what to have exactly and also have the most warm and welcome experience!!! Thank you team."
"The food was top notch. The ambience and the service was really great!! Our requests and comfort were well taken care of.
The person who attended us was Abhishek and he was very hospitable. 
I also received this surprise gift for my birthday!!"
Very well serviced by debdut & subhangi very pleased with their service food is awesome ambience was very good overall decoration is very eye catchy.debdutt having a broad knowledge of wine that is very impressive.
"I couldnt stay in the hotel as it was full, but we went there for dinner at their poolside restaurant and it was fabulous. The food, the ambience, the weather, everything was perfect mix. I am especially touched by Debayan who served us during the dinner and he was exceptional. So kind, friendly and thoughtful. He ensured that our dinner was most memorable experience of Kolkata trip."
My stay at The Oberoi Grand was immensely wonderful and lovely. The hotel is literally Grand and the interiors are so warm and pretty. Loved the food. Vicky was very very helpful at the reception with my queries. Shall visit again definitely.
Had a wonderful time at Baan Thai. The food was excellent and so where the people. The stir fried mushroom is highly recommended as is the grilled prawns.  Had a very nice time. Would love to come back
"The food was good - the appetizers were great, the lobster was good and the pad Thai was a bit too Indianized. Wine was ok. The service (by Tenzing) was great. The Grand hotel itself is beautiful and it’s worth going there just to see the grandeur (no pun intended) of the place."
"We throughly enjoyed our stay and the wonderful hospitality that the staff provided in true Oberoi fashion. Checkin was a delight with Arpan and his staff. We enjoyed the service at breakfast. Our room was serviced by a very courteous team. Syed Sultana from housekeeping left us a gracious note and a thoughtful book as a gift.
A special treat was the tour of the property that we received from Amitava Sarkar. Mr. Sarkar, who is a true gentleman, told us the story of the hotel while showing us some of its hidden secrets. His enthusiasm was infectious, we too are now Oberoi fans (beware Taj)."
"We came over expecting a pleasant family lunch, and we had an amazing time and some extremely delicious cuisines. Special thanks to Debdut Mukherjee for his extreme support and amazing service.
It has been an extreme pleasure being here and looking forward to future visits."
"Classic Oberoi service and hospitality - most thoughtful staff from the front desk to the housekeeping- will be back soon!
Koushikee Prerona and Aaron (the concierge) made sure we were comfortable. The housekeeping surprised me with a replenishment of toiletries- great gesture!"
"Have stayed in some of the best Oberoi hotels but this one will always be special being closer to home. Welcome letter/email from the General Manager Mayan Dhawan mentions “welcome home” and I totally agree with it. Being one of the iconic hotel of the city even the chain, the hotel and each and every staff showcase and deliver the very essence of the city, the very culture & tradition of the city. Without forgetting the brand everybody takes special effort to give a personal touch to ensure that you feel as good as being at home. 
The front desk team is not only professional but creates a comfort level, building great rapport with guests and family. The team is super helpful in going out of there way to help even with requests like suggestions and booking outside the property. 
The fantastic room reservation team and Varun Sharma needs a special mention for extending all possible help when it’s required.
In room dining and Three Sixty also matches with the expectation and delivers at top level each and every time I have visited. The young energetic super friendly engaging team - it’s always feel good time visiting the restaurant. Apart from the service, the food does not disappoint either. 
Maintaining such an old iconic hotel is not an easy task and the house keeping and maintenance team is doing a great job. Nice clean safe rooms even the common areas are kept spick and span.
Lastly as they say the first impression is the last impression, the concierge team just ensures that you are warmly welcomed and enter the hotel with a nice feeling…"
Best Thai food that I have had!!! We had soups- Tom Yum and Tom Kha. Both were wholesome and authentic. We followed ot with a pad Thai and some chicken (don't remember the name but deliciously crisp and saucy). We were treated to some Fuyong and some water spinach which were lip smacking!! The citrus cheesecake was flavourful and nice. Our server Tenzing was simply amazing with smiling eyes (he wore a mask!) Overall a delightful experience!!! Definitely recommend!!!!
"My stay at the hotel was absolutely comfortable and overwhelming. Had it not been my work, would have loved to stay a bit longer and explored but I guess that means I shall be visiting soon. Immensely in love with the people and food of Calcitta. Thanks to Vicky at the lobby who helped me in reservation and made it even more comfortable."
We stayed here a short vacation with our kids and we absolutely enjoyed our stay thoroughly. The hotel made sure to take care of us and the small ones starting from checkin to checkout. Loved the small small gifts left behind in the room and goodies we receive at the breakfast/dinner table. Everybody is great and cheerful but would love to mention Vicky for gifting us the hamper during checkout. That was such a nice gesture and we shall cherish us till our next visit.
"Have stayed here for couple of times now and everytime it is better than the previous one. Absolutely in love with vintage room, quiet environment, great food, great breakfast options. The staffs are great and now they even just understand what I need. Would love to mention Vicky at the Front Desk who takes care of all my needs."
"We came to celebrate my parents' anniversary, and the meal and services were excellent. Everyone was extremely well mannered and hospitable. The staff made our stay overall very memorable. Gurpreet was with us from the beginning of the trip and took care of our every need."
"Every single person is so passionate about their work and I had so many Aha moments in my two days stay here.. They have an extra eye for detail which makes them so special and it's a royal treat to stay here..

Must stay for the grandeur and more so for all the warmth they shower"
The food at grand is amazing. Debdut was our food advisor..and the dishes he suggested were excellent we thoroughly enjoyed the food..a 5 on 5 for staff behaviour so hospitable and helpful..!! Waiting to drop in soon.
We came to Baan Thai to celebrate my parents' anniversary. The meal was excellent and the service was even better. Nayanika was lovely and brought us dessert on the house. The experience was fantastic and we will definitely be back.
"I met Debdut and i want this guy to be recognized publicly because he is phenomenal. He was smart, caring and knowledgeable about the food and drinks. He just had his friendly demeanor about him and made my day. 

He is the best waiter i have ever had in India. 
Food was also great which was suggested by him. In kolkata if i ever have visit again will come to this place ( Oberoi Grand) only so that i can meet Debdut again. I wish him a great success in his life. 

Thank you so much Debdut for your exceptional service. You made my visit memorable at this place."
"Lovely dinner at the pool side.food was too notch. Especially the Eggplant parmesan was outstanding. Fabulous service by Nilanjan. Thank you for the lovely caramel espresso martini!! Anniversary well spent. 

Thank you for a brilliant night. "
"It's a bit odd, that you stay in a 5-star property with family in the same city where you live. But I decided to plan my anniversary the same way. I choose Oberoi Grand Kolkata. This property is a heritage of Kolkata. It was my childhood dream also. 
The experience was super, starting from check-in to check-out. 
The food was delicious.
Thanks for the Anniversary Cake, it makes our stay even better."
Loved the food ambience and the servce by the staff. Would surely recommend to my friends and family. Defintly would rate 5 stars. Everyone will love it also do visit with family for a Pleasant time👌🏻👌🏻
"Went with my family on a special occasion to Baan Thai, really good service and great food. Our waiter Asif was really polite and catered to all our needs.
Try out the Nam Phrik Phao (with Chicken)
+points for the ambience."
"The Oberoi Grand has always been special due to its charm, old school feel, understated and yet classy ambience..but what always takes the cake is the magnetic personality and warm hospitality of the young extremely well-groomed Oberoi staff. No exception this time, as well!
We were at the Thee Sixty Three hoping for a nice lunch. Debdut and Suvbarna Gurung  are young, precious gems who ensured that we have an awesome lunch..their knowledge, confidence and most importantly, passion to make every guest feel special shone bright! 

Thank you, Oberoi Grand, as always for making our visit memorable! Thank you, Debdut and Gurung, once again!"
"The service as well as the food are equally brilliant. The ambience is very peaceful.
Great for occasions and celebrations. The fish and prawn are elite. 
Would 10/10 recommend this place.
The green Thai curry is amazing :)"
"Food and hospitality of the restaurant was outstanding! I am very impressed with the way Abhishek attended us, suggested food, and served us. I have visited this hotel after a long time. Nothing has changed. Hope to visit again! :)"
"Extremely content about my recent stay at The Oberoi Grand in Calcutta. I had heard about the service of Oberois and was left stunned seeing how they exceeded my expectations. They take care of small things and go beyond all to make our stay lush and comfortable. Due to my business travels I do stay at different many properties across but this business trip had instances which overwhelms me and I would love to come with family for vacations.

Starting from checkin - I was welcomed with warm smiles and upon just mentioning that I am a sucker of fresh air, Vicky took me to one of the Balcony rooms which had the most amazing view and the coverage area was a bonus. Also huge thanks to Vicky for taking care of my stay and everything just through a text.

The food was great and somehow it felt very much homelike. Absolutely loved the Thai restaurant and the breakfast spread."
"Had a great time at Oberoi Grand Ban Thai. Excellent t food and ambiemce to complement our 26th Marriage Anniversary dinner .                                                          
THANKS Ankit for your service and advice on the right food . You been a great help"
"My stay at the hotel was well taken care of. The room was cozy and comfortable and had its own old world charm. I wish I could stay longer but had to move out soon due to my business trips. Would like to mention Vicky at the Front Desk for all his help. He impeccably reduced my extra work load by helping me in my paper work. Loved the care and professionalism. 
Would love to visit soon."
We had a very good experience dining at Three Sixty Three restaurant. The food quality and ambience was great . We were helped to a great extent by Abhishek in our food selection. His recommendation of Country Chicken and Coconut Rice was delicious. Even the starters were very good. Overall we liked it very much.
"We visited three sixty three on 5th of Feb and was attended by Mr Debdut.

He was extremely professional and polite with his service.

He helped us the best delicacies from the menu and also curated dishes according our taste.

Spectacular service. Keep it up and keep delighting all you come in touch with.

Thank you Mr Debdut for one of the finest service.

Funfact: Apart for the exceptional service, Mr Debdut is also a Table tennis player enthusiast and has played India under 14 tournaments and coached several people on the same."
"Oberoi Grand is an incredibly wonderful place to pick if you are visiting Kolkata. Each and every member of the staff is very warm and their service is par excellence. Not to mention, the hotel is a heritage property and a part of Kolkata’s history and identity of being a melting pot of cultures. Each and every corner of the hotel has a unique story to tell. Do request for the hotel orientation tour when you check in to know the fascinating story of this building! You are sure to be left awestruck!"
"this was a great stay , this is far better than ITC , we had a great time here  . breakfast was great . and above all the staffs are very humble , koushikee helped me right from checkin till check out . pritam was also helpful . ill come back with family again"
Thanks to Vicky for suggesting us the pool side for our dinner. We keep coming often but had never tried the pool side and he happen to recognise us and suggested to try out the pool side. Debayan at the pool who took care of us was really great.
"Excellent food and hospitality! The preparations were made to their optimal quality! The service was one of the best we have experienced, thanks to Khitish who did a great job in that department. Would definitely like to visit again."
"Food was awesome, hospitality even better - Mr. Ankit was extremely welcoming, charming and made sure we are not only full but happy too!! I guess, it’s just not the chef and food that makes this restaurant one of the best in India, it’s also the hospitality and front ofc staff that adds to the pleasure. A must visit if you are in Kolkata!!"
"Stay was awesome,Food was as usual yummy .
Took proper care of hygiene and covid rules were followed too 
Best part was the hotel tour hy Mr Sarkar.
He told us such old time stories about the origin of the hotel 
Thanks a lot Mr Sarkar ,you took us way back in time ......🙏
One must visit the hotel of in kolkata
Stay is wonderful."
"We were welcomed by Vicky for our stay. He surprised us cake wine and sweet hampers. The gesture was very sweet. We loved every bit of our stay. The food is great and fulfilling. 
As promised we are celebrating all our anniversary here."
My stay was very comfortable. Thanks to Vicky for all the help. It was a last minute room request and I was made comfortable in a room as needed. The restaurant 363 serves the best food. Absolutely loved the thali style food. So sumptuous. Thanks to everyone. Keep up the good work
"We had a short one night stay at The Oberoi Grand Kolkata and it was seemingly perfect. Upon checkin we were upgraded to room which had balcony and that was the best thing ever that ever happened to us in hotels. Vicky was very charming and sweet and walked us to the room. The room was specially decorated for our anniversary. We were so overwhelmed. 

I happen to mention that it was our first visit to Kolkata and I love sweets. He even packed special bengali sweets. We immensely loved it.

Please do choose the hotel to make your special days more special"
"The concierge desk was extremely helpful end-to-end. Although my booking at the Oberoi Grand was made shortly before arrival at Kolkata airport, Aaron from concierge reached out to make sure the hotel car was waiting as my flight arrived after midnight. He also arranged an excellent tour of Kolkata with an excellent local resident expert of the city that made my visit more authentic. My flight got rescheduled due to covid and Aaron was extremely helpful to arrange my luggage to be delivered to me. Thank you for the strong follow-through from the concierge team. The front desk team is highly personal in their approach, they remember guests and ensured I was comfortable throughout my stay. Soumajit and Arpan checked with me to make sure I was happy at the Oberoi Grand from the point of check in and I found the front desk to be very open and willing to help which I continue to appreciate. Special mention to Ankit in the Thai restaurant who recommended a delicious dinner despite a late night order, as well as Ajay in the driveway who provided great advice for the local area . Thank you!"
"Excellent service by Rishi at 360 degree. Great soup and fantastic fare. Amazing poolside view, enjoyed the lunch thoroughly. Kids really enjoyed the ambience and they were very happy. Thanks to the entire team Oberoi Kolkata"
"It was a pleasure hopping in for coffee after the hustle and bustle of the streets in Kolkata.
I was served by Abhishek, who was well aware of his job and also a pleasant young man. 
I highly recommend- Cold coffee and chilli toast"
"Had a great time today with family. Perfect atmosphere to catch-up with friends and relatives amidst the hustle in the heart of Kolkata. Excellent food, awesome ambience. Special thanks to Rishi Raj for being so courteous. Highly recommended!"
"It was a quick ""work from hotel"" stay and everything went great. Starting from reservation to checkin everything was smooth. The room was spacious and well furnished. Thanks to Vicky for arranging everything on s very short notice. Absolutely loved the service. The restaurants are great. Even though they had some ups and down they knew their job and left no stone unturned to leave a great impact. Shall be back very soon."
I am just wowed by the hospitality received at The Oberoi Grand Kolkata. It was a very very nice and comfortable stay. The people are so so ready to help and make the stay even more comfortable. The room was the highlight. Everything is just top notch. They do take care of ALL your requests. You just need to say it. Thanks to Vicky for assisting with late night queries.
"Hardik Rathod  
Was very good who provided me with awesome service.
Since I was in in COVID so your team helped me out very well. And among other hotels I the area this hotels has been providing with such good food and best people."
"Every time I come to Grand Oberoi Kolkata I get a new experience. Marvelous hospitality. The sunbath on the spacious porticos, the customized bed and the food are the hallmarks you seldom forget about. Koushikee and purity helped . So thank you. I'll come back"
"Oberoi Grand always had special place in my heart with full of childhood memories but I never chose to stay here. Now I am thinking why I didn’t stay here before. Best thing about the place is they have kept the history intact full of class. Meticulously made sure old charm and modern facilities coexisted seamlessly. Best part were the staff. Everyone of them, such young crew, yet knew the whole history of the place and could hold lovely conversation. So many to name but here are few of them I would thank specially: Debdut 
Rishi raj
Debdutt
Debayan 
Ankit 
Priti
Koushikee
Soumyajit - duty manager
Also thanks so much for arranging my early check in!! It was a life saver.
Can’t wait to be back!!"
"Ankit and Tenzing at Baan Thai  helped us a lot with all the authentic Thai food they were really courteous and helped us a lot, excellent dinner should visit Baan Thai when you are in the city had Stir fry prawn and Phad Thai noodles 😀"
"It was an amazing experience altogether. The food, hospitality, ambience, everything was outstanding.
Chanda, Ankit and Asif who waited upon us were so polite, professional and amiable. Would visit again!"
"Please, if you are visiting Kolkata, stay at the Oberoi Grand. I've stayed several times, and somehow, each time is better than the last. The staff are exceptional and their hospitality is the perfect balance of generous and respectful. You're in the heart of the city but the hotel itself is an absolute oasis of calm."
Baan Thai was Great. Also Koushikee Ma'am and Soumyojit Sir were great with the check in and check out procedure.The food was great also in the threesixtythree must try the buffet breakfast and the camemburger.The minibar was also like a cherry on the top.
The service at the hotel oberoi was exceptional. We were particularly impressed with how the hotel staff anticipated our needs especially Mr Hardik Rathod. We loved how he was always polite and helpful.
"We had  a lovely dinner at the Oberoi Grand poolside. we had the prawn risotto and thai yellow curry . The  food, service and ambience was lovely.  Will definitely be back soon . A special shout out to  Tushar who very kindly made us taste Banana bread which we last ate a couple of decades ago! Taking some home!"
"Mr Debdut served us, and were very happy with the service.
He is very attentive and has a very plaesant personality.
He was very courteous and the service was very exceptional. We were very very happy.
Thank you"
"We took a quick impromptu detour at the Oberoi, Grand on an early morning, right before our trip. We were hungry and wanted to catch a quick bite. 

Debdut Mukherjee, our host was extremely courteous and accomodating. We just wanted a cup of tea and he went out of his way to make us a pot himself as it was quite early in the morning. The tea reminded us of home.

We weren't too hungry but he offered us some delicious omlettes and hashbrown, stating that it is a ritual for Bengalis to have at least a bit of something before leaving home.

Once we were done and called for the cheque, he casually said that it's been taken care of. We were genuinely touched by the whole gesture. 

But what makes this experience worth remembering is the heart warming approach that Debdut and Oberoi extended to us.

What a great start to the trip!

P.S. The food on the plate is half eaten - too delicious to resist!"
"Writing here my experience is totally different of what I felt staying at the Oberoi Grand Kolkata.

My late night almost early morning arrival was handled by Vicky with great sophostication. That was super quick and included no unnecessary conversation as he understood I was tired. Due to flight delays I decided to order my dinner. Thanks to Vicky again for getting my order ready on time in the room. And thanks for extra mayonnaise 😋. I loved the service, the people, the hospitality something which we miss out on international chain. So thanks to Vicky and Grand for initiating the spark in me for Oberois. Shall be visiting more often now."
"Rajib: we had nice dinner. Taste was really good for all the items chosen. They guided well too.
The guide was Ankit. His recommendation helped us to choose. Ambience was also superb.

We also had a nice surprise as a anniversary cake at the end."
"We went for our 10th anniversary dinner at the pool side at Oberoi’s. The service provided by Niranjan was fabulous. We were made to feel very special . 
The food and ambiance of the place was outstanding…
Niranjan took the effort to capture the moment for us…
He was very courteous and polite…"
"The ""Royal Taste"" of the hospitality. Highly recommended to all. The best of the best service ever I seen. 100% satisfied. In future if I get the scope then again I will be happy to stay at The Oberoi Grand, Kolkata again and again. Hats off to all the members of The Oberoi Group."
Absolutely loved our stay at the hotel. We were upgraded by Vicky on our special occasion and Ruchika was sweet enough to take us through our room. The room was so well designed and chic. Loved the food and the ambience and the stay added to our Celebration.0
"I am a regular in Baan Thai, and never go back unsatisfied. Khitish and Ishali made sure that our experience is great and also customised the food as per our requirement. Amazing ambience and service."
The food was exotic. Enjoyed it very much. The ambience was fantastic. The service was extremely good. The staff are extremely polite. Doma had served us and I found her to be extremely polite and efficient. The birthday cake was outstanding. Was referred to 363 by one of my friends. Wish to visit again.
"Had a great time here. The service was excellent and the food top notch.

The tofu is a must-try. The soups are all great, with the chefs special Thai curry being one of a kind.

The authentic ambience brings it all together in a seamless delectable blend."
"We traveled to Kolkata as a family and stayed at The Oberoi Grand for couple of days. The one thing which we highly recommend to anyone travelling during these times is that The Grand takes ALL the necessary precautions. Our checkin was completely contactless from the point of making the reservation. The rooms were kept sanitized. The hotel itself is so clean and hygienic. The people are so friendly yet aware if their surroundings. Entering the hotel felt like a positivity against  our fearless to the pandemic.

The rooms are wonderful and elegant. The food is great for food lovers. We were lucky enough to take a tour of the hotel and feel the greatness of each wall and painting we crossed. All the very best to Vicky there at the Front Desk to make our stay even more wonderful and cherishable.

Love and Regards
Sattar Family."
Fantastic Services…..Awesome food true to taste & excellent service of Mr. Khitish from 363 deg made it extra special. Try the Thai & Japanese cuisine which are so authentic & flavourful……the Anglo Indian chicken cutlet is also very good & refreshes your old kolkata memories…. Definitely a must try place for amazing experience.
The food was really good. Would definitely recommend to all of you. Relished everything right from appetizers to dessert. The drinks were also quite good. The service was very fast. Loved the ambience too
"We had a remarkable stay at The Grand Hotel, a landmark of Kolkata’s past, present and bright future. If you wish to immerse yourself in this city, The Grand is ideally located in Chowringhee. This marvelous hotel is a short walk to the Indian Museum and Asiatic Society and not far from Victoria Memorial. We also took a stroll through the Eden Gardens to the Hooghly River, a memorable experience! But while the Grand is an indisputable Landmark, I found it to be a Treasure and its people, the most precious gems. Each staff member is an Ambassador of Indian hospitality, a unique combination of excellence and care. I will not forget your wonderful “eye” smiles and greetings, your impeccable housekeeping, how you introduced me to green peas kachori and cholar dal and your professional guidance on the city, including excellent suggestions for art galleries. We also indulged in exceptional food and atmosphere at “Baan Thai” (loved the tiger prawns!). I cannot wait to visit you again! Thank you for allowing me a glimpse of the soul of this marvelous city!"
"I would highly recommend travellers to stop by at The Oberoi Grand. I was on a train to Calcutta when I happened to call the hotel super early in the morning and cut to 10 minutes I received a confirmation mail with all my needs. Vicky was so efficient and knew exactly what I need and got everything ready within a short span of time. He even upgraded the rooms and made sure our stay was perfect. To people thinking making reservation is a task, its actually a cake walk and the hotel is the cherry on top. Beautifully located i'm the heart of the city. The interiors are worth staring. This was a very short trip but has definitely left a impact."
"Loved my business trip at The Oberoi Grand. Great location, beautiful property, antique yet cozy rooms. Great workforce and efforts. Sumptuous food. Overall a good package for a stay or a vacation. Also mention to Vicky at the lobby for assisting through and through out."
"We stayed at The Oberoi Grand for a short vacation and absolute loved it. The hotel, it's location, it's people and the food is top notch. We were delighted since our checkin and it continued till the checkout. Thanks to Vicky for all the help and assistance. The breakfast spread is so far the best in the city."
"We as a family travel quite a lot of places but unfortunately had never stayed in Oberois before. Due to lockdown while we were state-locked, we planned to break out to The Oberoi Grand during New Years and now we are in absolute love for the brand.

Starting from the checkin which was smooth as never seen before. The happiness that radiates in the people standing on the other side of the count is impeccable. We were WALKED to the room and that is so new to us in today's world. That conversation, that human touch is what one should experience atleast once. The stay was beyond perfect. Housekeeping makes sure they treat you like their children and keep on checking on you to ensure that the stay is well taken care of. We were lucky to usher 2022 by the pool side and the evening was so extravagant. We tried possibly everything - 363, Baan Thai, Pool Side and even the Spa : and it somehow leaves us so speechless that every nook and crook of the facility provided felt so warm and overwhelming.

Apologies for the delayed review but would definitely mention names of people who made it extra special. 
When it came to housekeeping - Siddharth was a gem.
Our table care takers were elegant too and knew their job ( I cannot recall them but huge thanks to those guys)
When it came to check out - Vicky made it so special by continuing the checkout formalities at the Poolside as we were running late for our Destination but also wanted to enjoy the last coffee at The Grand. He was true example of ""Hospitality beyond books"". 

You guys should definitely keep up the spirit and see you soon and more often.

Regards
Soumik"

"Sometimes you get the best and are surprised from places you would have never expected. Our evening was getting wasted because of the unavailability of reservation at various restaurants and children not allowed in some.

Finally after seeing a lot on the review websites we came upto Noir at Golden Tulip and we made the call. They happily agreed with children and reservations and we ultimately reached there.

Noir is on the roof top and we were also told that if we find the place to be cold or windy then we can shift down-stairs also which is indoor and enclosed. After sitting for some minutes we had to move to down-stairs as it was getting cold and windy too. The whole setup on the roof and down-stairs is good and amazing. You would love to spend your times here.

We ordered cheese garlic bread for our child and american corn sal and pepper american corn and american veg sizzler for ourselves. Trust me when I say those were among the best ones we ever had. Their taste still linger on our tongues. Superb sizzler. Awesome american corn. Delicious garlic bread. I mean what could have been better for an evening which was about to go wasted.

What a fast service. Super people. Worth remembering staff. Special mention and thanx to our server Anindita for her recommendations and amazing behaviour and service. She cooperated so well in all our wants.

I would highly recommend this place for chilling and enjoying really good food. I have become a fan. Generally I do not like to go to any restaurant twice but to this place I would surely go."
It was a pleasant stay. The staff was cordial and well behaved. Slight improvement on extension as some other hotels also have. At times tweeking of rules are required subject to availability for the space. To make the stay more cordial otherwise great food and place.
"The service and accomodation is excellent, the room apperance is very good and aesthetic. I recommended to all  of them stay there for making pleasent the trip either business or official. The behaviour of staffs are excellent"

"My stay was very much comfortable and food quality is also good, moreover hotel staff is very much cooperative and helpful. 
Hotel location is very good and that is very good to commute in all directions of kolkata."
"I stayed at the hotel for almost 42 days ( last week of November'20 to 5th Jan'21)

Located in a very serene neighbourhood, very close to city centre

I must say, the hotel staff has been amazing - the reception team, the antipasti guys, the housekeeping staff, the noir folks
10/10 for the courtesy, mannerisms

Room no. 705 for 1p or 2p, it has the  best view. I found the rooms smaller but I got used to it, it wasn't a major let down. The staff was kind enough to offer me an upgrade which I did have a look at, but still chose room no 705.
Did not use the TV at all, had brought an HDMI cable - connected my laptop to the tv
The work desk is very compact, other than a laptop and a mouse you may not find room to keep much things on the desk

Breakfast -  8.5/10 - they've got options but due to low occupancy in covid, the buffet was discontinued for sometime. Otherwise, the options are good and the food is tasty - 
crunchy chicken, chicken cutlet, cheess+mushroom omlette, masala dosa, onion uttapam, medu vada, poha, rabri+rasagulla, fresh juices

They have a small gym on the ground-floor beside the main entrance, found out about it later. There are a few equipments.

During my stay - there took place probably 2 or 3 weddings, there was a fashion show on the 1st floor

The Lebanese Resto Bar, right adjacent to my room - 7/10

Noir - the rooftop hotel - is a welcome place on weekends. Do try out their sizzlers (prawns, mutton, chicken), alcohol is priced a lil higher
There is a small pool here. You may sit at the edge of the pool with your feet in the water - i didnt try it, the weather was v cold and the water as well.

The band that played live music at Noir on weekends - The Antique Nation - wonderful ppl. Made friends with them, I was treated to many music jam sessions, 
Subhankar, Sayantan, Subho - you guys rock!!

Arpita, Prabhashish, Chandita - thank you for the cake on my birthday, it was a very sweet gesture!
Also, thank you for a warm farewell! :)
Arpita - you rock!

Antipasti - Amit, Ishika - thank you for the breakfast, and for getting it customized at times, pass on the wishes to the chef
I'll miss crunchy chicken
Amit - thank you for arranging breakfast whenever I got late, and for the coffee, the way I wanted it - strong, lots of milk, with sugar
Bubai, Avik, Gulti - thanks guys!

Housekeeping staff - Saheb, Tumpa, Partha - thank you folks for making the room pristine. Somehow, I always ended up making a mess. 

Noir - Mousami, Sam, Diptiman, Soumitro - shoutout to you guys!
I brought my colleagues and few friends to Noir. They liked the place.

I might have missed a few names, but thanks to the staff for ensuring I had a v pleasant stay.

Would definitely recommend Golden Tulip.

Golden Tulip Mgmt - If I come to Kolkata next time, and choose Golden Tulip - allot me Room No. 705"

Had a comfortable stay in Golden Tulip last week. The place is conveniently located. Staff is helpful and friendly. Would recommend this if you are on a business trip to kolkata. Food options are limited.
While every thing was near perfect there was a small negligence in keeping an unusable wooden chair in the room. While rested my back the back rest could not support became flat and I hurt back of my head as it struck the wall.Housekeeping staff were however helpful in  offering first aid. Minus this incident I will rate the hotel as very good to excellent.
"Was a pleasant stay with family.
Hotel was clean

"Will
Definitely going to stay again. The breakfast and Dinner buffet had varieties. Definitely going to visit them again on food. Though some food misses in taste. But it’s alright. The staffs were courteous. Prompt service."
Stay was comfortable and luxurious. Hotel stuffs are very courtesious. Foods are delicious and buffet was also good. Check in and check out process was also very first. I didn't had to wait for long. 😊
"Barbeque Mania festival's menu of meats is well thought through, with good selections for fish, mutton, lamb and chicken. While the choices for meats are not extensive, the quality is more than enough to satisfy. If you like barbecue and drinks, then file this aside for special nights out. Barbeque Mania at Noir, Golden Tulip is perfect for a spot-on combination of grilling and slurping. As it turns out, their charcoal-fired barbecue is laud-worthy under open sky with live music.

Expect well-marinated Cottage Cheese Shish Taouk — think juicy and melt-in-the-mouth Cottage Cheese! Along with the Cottage Cheese Shish Taouk come some really stellar side dishes, one of which is a fluffy, perfectly soft Baby Naan. The simple creaminess of Cottage Cheese Shish Taouk offers a welcome break from all the grilled meats, rebooting the palate for round two, and three...

We highly recommends the Chimi Churi Fish, which features an assortment of fresh cuts fish fillet marinated with green Chimi Churi sauce. The fish chunks come doused in a refreshing yet tangy sauce that added flavour without overpowering. This signature Chimi Churi Fish, sees juicy fish fillets char-grilled to perfection. Be sure to dunk the Chimi Churi Fish into their spicy house dip!

The Chicken Shish Taouk, which comes with a well-marinated selection of chicken meats along with onions and bell peppers. You will cook the meats over a small charcoal barbecue fire at the table (you'll have to work for your food) — it takes awhile, so make sure you have a good company.

 Another dish worth ordering is Mutton and Chicken Seekh Kebab, which sees slightly crisp seekh kebabs with a nice bite — just be sure not to overcook it! Be sure not to miss Chef's much loved special Mutton and Chicken Seekh Kebab. It comes perfectly charred with a slightly crystallised exterior and tender meat that's just the right amount of lean and fat, just yum!"

"The hotel does not have a very prominent location as it's in a bylane not visible from the main road. 

The rooms are comfortable and maintained well. The housekeeping staff are very friendly and cooperative as also the front desk. But in the winter months it's an agony if you pay so much and you can't get hot water in your shower to enjoy your bath. Throughout our stay if about a week, we had to request housekeeping who got us hot water in a bucket!!! Whatever was the technical issue could not get rectified by the Management. It was taking so much time! 

The breakfast does have variety of veg as well as nonveg but you have to constantly request them to serve hot food. The footfall there is good and lots of tables are occupied in the morning during breakfast. The food is well done and I have enjoyed my meals. 

Overall the stay was comfortable and good."
